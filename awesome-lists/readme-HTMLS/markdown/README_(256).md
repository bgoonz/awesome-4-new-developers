# Awesome LIDAR [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

<img src="img/lidar.svg" width="100" />

> A curated list of awesome LIDAR sensors and its applications.

[LIDAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar) is a remote sensing sensor that uses laser light to measure the surroundings in ~cm accuracy. The sensory data is usually referred as point cloud which means set of data points in 3D or 2D. The list contains hardwares, datasets, point cloud-processing algorithms, point cloud frameworks, simulators etc.
