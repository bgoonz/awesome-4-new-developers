        SPACE - it‚Äôs name suggests, that it can be used like U+2060 WORD JOINER.
        And in fact the latter was introduced to inherit its semantics. This is
        because U+FEFF had become a special beacon called the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark"
          >byte order mark</a
        >, that was placed on the beginning of some UTF-8 files. In complying
        software (including many text editors) this character is stripped from
        the start of a file and handled as metadata. In non-complying software
        (like the PHP interpreter) this leads to all sorts of fun behaviour.

          Diacritics and combining marks: There is a
          <a href="https://codepoints.net/search?gc=Mn">host of characters</a>,
          that add to the characters before. Those are called Combining Marks.
          Unicode provides a
          <a href="http://unicode.org/faq/char_combmark.html">handy FAQ</a> on
          the details, but in a nutshell: If you add one after a character, it
          is placed on top of that previous one. So, <code>a + Ãä = √•</code>. This
          <em>may</em> lead to all kinds of funny problems, because for some
          combinations there are pre-composed characters. Our little
          <code>√•</code> here can also be encoded as U+00E5. You might note,
          that while this has a length of one character, the combination of
          <code>a</code> and combining ring has a length of two characters.
        </p>
        Of course, one can also do fun things with those characters like
        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/113195">this answer</a> on
        StackOverflow.

          U+1F1E6 to U+1F1FF resemble the 26 latin characters. They are used to
          create flag emoji. Since the Unicode consortium didn‚Äôt feel like
          getting on board with international politics, the solution to flags is
          to combine these 26 characters to the respective ISO code for a
          country. Examples:

          Skin color of emoji: There are five code points, that control the skin
          color of emoji,
          <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+1F3FB..U+1F3FF"
            >U+1F3FB to U+1F3FF</a
          >. They are called ‚ÄúEmoji Modifier Fitzpatrick Type‚Äù 1 to 6, with 1
          the palest and 6 the darkest. If one of these characters follows an
          emoji, that emoji is meant to be rendered in the appropriate skin
          color of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale"
            >the Fitzpatrick scale</a
          >. If no such modifier is added, the skin tone should be unnatural,
          e.‚Ääg., bright yellow. Fun fact: Since the Fitzpatrick modifiers are
          normal code points, emoji with such skin colors have the length 2,
          which Twitter users noticed first. Here is a comparison chart

      <li>
        <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+00AD">U+00AD</a> SOFT HYPHEN - (in

        if (and only if) a break occurs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+200B">U+200B</a> ZERO WIDTH SPACE -
        the inverse to U+00A0: create no space, but allow word breaking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+200D">U+200D</a> ZERO WIDTH JOINER -
        force adjacent characters to be joined together (e.g., arabic characters
        or supported emoji). Apple uses this to compose some emoji like
        different families.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://codepoints.net/U+2060">U+2060</a> WORD JOINER - the
        same as U+00A0, but completely invisible. Good for writing
        <code>@font-face</code> on Twitter.

        According to the standard: ‚Äú* while this character is imaged as a
        fixed-width blank in many fonts, it does not act as a space‚Äù Essentially
        it is rendered as white-space, but since it is designated as
        <em>not</em> white-space it isn‚Äôt matched by white-space-validating
        regular expressions. This can be used to bypass all kinds of validation
        that disallows or trims white-space.
