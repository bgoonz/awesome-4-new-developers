        navigation routing and communication via real-time events, websockets,
        and backend API servers. Its test suite is not that extensive but does

        developers could easily understand how routing in clojurescript
        applications can work. It is also full of many examples of how to build
        a component based frontend architecture that is part of an interactive
        graphics application i.e. where many components manipulate the HTML5
        canvas or work with HTML5 APIs.
