        the notion of a Strong AI possessing a ‘mind’ or a ‘consciousness’, and
        interesting reading for those interested in the intersection of AI and

        - Written by Douglas Hofstadter and taglined “a metaphorical fugue on
        minds and machines in the spirit of Lewis Carroll”, this wonderful
        journey into the the fundamental concepts of mathematics,symmetry and
        intelligence won a Pulitzer Price for Non-Fiction in 1979. A major theme
        throughout is the emergence of meaning from seemingly ‘meaningless’
        elements, like 1’s and 0’s, arranged in special patterns.
