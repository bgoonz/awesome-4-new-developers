        >Cybersecurity blue teams</a
      >
      are groups of individuals who identify security flaws in information
      technology systems, verify the effectiveness of security measures, and
      monitor the systems to ensure that implemented defensive measures remain
      effective in the future. While not exclusive, this list is heavily biased
      towards
      <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>
      projects and against proprietary products or corporate services. For
      offensive TTPs, please see

      Many cybersecurity professionals enable racist state violence, wittingly
      or unwittingly, by providing services to local, state, and federal
      policing agencies or otherwise cooperating with similar institutions who
      do so. This evil most often happens through the coercive mechanism of
      employment under threat of lack of access to food, shelter, or healthcare.
      Despite this list’s public availability, it is the maintainer’s intention
      and hope that this list supports the people and organizations who work to
      counter such massive albeit banal evil.
