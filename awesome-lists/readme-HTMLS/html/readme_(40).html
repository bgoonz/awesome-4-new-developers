          - Recent scientific research calls into question the value of many
          long-standing password-security practices such as password expiration
          policies, and points instead to better alternatives such as enforcing
          banned-password lists and MFA.

    <h3 id="saml">SAML</h3>
    <p>
      Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 is a means to exchange
      authorization and authentication between services, like OAuth/OpenID
      protocols above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical SAML identity provider is an institution or a big corporation‚Äôs
      internal SSO, while the typical OIDC/OAuth provider is a tech company that
      runs a data silo.

            >SAML vs.¬†OAuth</a

          - ‚ÄúOAuth is a protocol for authorization: it ensures Bob goes to the
          right parking lot. In contrast, SAML is a protocol for authentication,
          or allowing Bob to get past the guardhouse.‚Äù

          - ‚ÄúEven though SAML was actually designed to be widely applicable, its
          contemporary usage is typically shifted towards enterprise SSO
          scenarios. On the other hand, OAuth was designed for use with
          applications on the Internet, especially for delegated authorisation.‚Äù
