      A compilation of advices, anecdotes, knowledge tidbits, discussions,
      industry small-talks and rants. A bibliography of sort, gathered the last
      few years while

        >transitioning my career from a software engineer to an engineer’s
        manager</a

      recursion right? ʘ‿ʘ).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You’re a developer and wonders what it feels like to be a manager?
      </li>
      <li>You just started your first position as the leader of a team?</li>
      <li>You’re stuck into the day-to-day operations of the job?</li>
      <li>How can I move up to the next level?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You’ll find answers in this guide! It stands out from generic leadership
      and management literature, by providing uncompromising insights and
      practical advices to bootstrap your journey into the management career
      track, from a technical background.
    </p>
    <p>
      This list provides a progression to help with the transition to
      management. From general to specifics. It starts with an overview of the
      role, then describes its requirements, and its position relative to
      others. Then we delves into the day-to-day tools of the trade, both
      organizational and behavioral. At last we discuss about some of the dark
      sides of the job.

          - “Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than
          anything else, was critical to making a team work. (…) The behaviors
          that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and
          empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as
          individuals, when we need to establish a bond.”

    <h3 id="executives">Executives</h3>
    <p>
      Executives are the senior/highest management layers of a company. They
      reports to a board of directors in bigger companies, or directly to the
      shareholders in smaller ones. Leadership is expected at this level. As a
      manager these are the people you report to.

      You’re in a competitive sector in which talents are in high demand. Be
      prepared as a manager to spend a lot of time recruiting people, either to
      expand your team or fill-in open positions. The dynamics now gets
      interesting too, now that you are on both sides of the hiring process: as
      a candidate to get a job, and as a recruiter to staff up your team.

          trusted, so it was as it should be. It made you feel like you were

          strong trust in your entourage.

      You shouldn’t spend your time coding. Leave that to the engineers: your
      value lies elsewhere now. But does that means you must forget all things
      technical? The answer is an astounding <em>NO</em>. Here are some

          - Because the short-term focused Scrum processes “seem suited to
          particular types of development, most notably consulting or contract
          programming, where the customer is external to the organizations, runs
          the show because they are paying for development, and can change their

          it will be difficult to be effective at any future job you go to, even
          if it is ostensibly a wonderful job. Treat burnout like a physical
