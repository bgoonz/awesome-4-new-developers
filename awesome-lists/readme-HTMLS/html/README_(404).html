      <p>
        There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation
        and naming things.

    <p>
      Concepts in computer science are usually nothing tangible so it’s no
      surprise that naming things is hard. Nevertheless, we <em>do</em> come up
      with clever, creative and funny names. Some of them so established, we
      never pause and admire.
    </p>
    <p>This is a curated list for when naming things is done right.</p>
