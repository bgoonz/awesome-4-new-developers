          >
          - by Lara Hogan. Takeaway: nine tips for getting off to a successful
          start, such as “find/create a peer support group” and “partner
          absurdly closely with product and make sure you understand priorities
          and the head of product understands tradeoffs.” Comes with
          explanations for each tip.

            >The ‘Aha’ Behind Leading Aha Moments</a
          >
          - by George Bradt. Takeaway: Aha moments are pleasurable, because the
          experience makes us feel smarter. Making others feel smart, not making
          others see how smart you are, is the goal.

          - by kate{mats}. Takeaway: “As a new technology executive it is
          imperative that you take the time to understand the technology
          strategy and risk and communicate that to senior management.” Comes
          with a great checklist for doing just that.

          - by Leo Polovets. Takeaway: Bottlenecks that prevent leaders from
          adapting to the role and scaling up include being good but not great;
          being unwilling to delegate, and not becoming well-rounded
          skills-wise. Listen to your gut, do 360-degree reviews, talk to great
          leadership peers and explore executive coaching to level up and
          overcome these hurdles.

          - by Rands in Repose. Takeaway: Think about the new work you’re
          creating with your words and actions. “The hard work of great
          leadership isn’t just managing the expected tasks that we can predict,
          it’s the art of successfully traversing the unexpected.”

          - by Charity Majors. Takeaway: “Fuck the whole idea that only managers
          get career progression. And fuckkkk the idea you have to choose a

            Made Them</a

          “not wanting to rock the boat,” “not setting boundaries,” “not giving
          direct feedback,” and “not firing fast enough” as her four mistakes,
          and explains why.

          >
          - by Marcus Blankenship. Takeaway: Avoid words like “just”, “simply”,

            >How to Fail as a New Engineering Manager</a
          >
          - by Brad Armstrong. Takeaway: You can fail by continuing to code;
          focusing only on work, not people; measuring your value by your
          output; expecting without expressing; leaving the team out of
          commitments; mistaking directing for leading; avoiding hard
          conversations; not learning your craft anymore.

            >How to Make the Leap from Engineer to Manager</a
          >
          - by Kirby Frugia at New Relic. Takeaway: “The key to making processes
          work is to make incremental changes, measure them, and then improve
          them.” Also, managerial success and developer success differ in that
          the former is often achieved through others, more about strategic
          impact, and happen less frequently.

            Demotion</a
          >
          - by Charity Majors. Takeaway: “Any technical company should work hard
          to center and celebrate the work being done to build the product and
          make customers happy. Management is overhead, to be brutally frank
          about it, and we should not design organizations that would lead any
          rational, ambitious person to aspire to be overhead, should we?”

          of a designer as my senior reports, I understood how to approach
          design at Facebook and could support my team members in setting
          ambitious goals and working effectively with their partners.”

            Journal</a
          >
          - by Dan Ciampa. Takeaway: “The French philosopher Blaise Pascal
          pointed out that ‘All of humanity’s problems come from man’s inability
          to sit quietly in a room alone.’ He didn’t mean sitting quietly in
          front of a laptop responding to emails. The best thinking comes from
          structured reflection — and the best way to do that is keeping a
          personal journal.”

          >
          - by Lighthouse. The article advocates Task Relevant Maturity,
          described like so: “How often you monitor should not be based on what
          you believe your subordinate can do in general, but on [their]
          experience with a specific task and [their] prior performance with it
          – [their] task relevant maturity…as the subordinate’s work improves
          over time, you should respond with a corresponding reduction in the
          intensity of the monitoring.”

            >The New Manager Death Spiral</a
          >
          - by Michael Lopp. Takeaway: management isn’t a promotion. Thinking,
          “I can do it all. I’m The Boss,” will lead you to take on too much
          responsibility and set yourself up for failure. Avoid this outcome by
          delegating, hiring a diverse team, and listening.

          - by Shem Magnezi. Takeaway: “[D]iscovering that I don’t have to be a
          manager to get promoted in a tech company was a huge relief. A lot of
          companies (and individuals) understand now that there is a place for
          engineers to grow as individuals outside of the management track, and
          every one of us should know about this alternative. For me—if I had
          had the opportunity to read this kind of post, I would have been
          thinking about my career development differently.”

          - by Jennifer Dary. Takeaway: “At the end of the day, you cannot
          control the emotional growth or maturity of anyone but yourself. So if
          your friend is going to hold it against you, if they’re going to be
          resentful and stick their tongue out when you’re not looking, then you
          keep on keeping on.”

          allegiance divided between the company and the people who depend on
          them. The obligation to the company is more formal, but the impact you
          have on your team is longer-lasting and more intimate. When the
          obligations to the employer and to your team collide in some way, make
          sure you can make the right call; it might be one of the the most
          consequential decisions you’ll ever make.”

            Seems</a
          >
          - by James Somers. Takeaway: “The obvious benefit to working quickly
          is that you’ll finish more stuff per unit time. But there’s more to it
          than that. If you work quickly, the cost of doing something new will
          seem lower in your mind. So you’ll be inclined to do more.”

          >
          - by Emma Brudner. Takeaway: Management can be lonely; you stop
          practicing your craft; GSD turns into GTD; you don’t get as much
          feedback; you have to do hard things (and you still have the same
          feelings); management is emotional; self-regulation, all day, every
          day; you spend less time in the spotlight; you’re the “shit umbrella”;
          your relationships change.

          Jessica McKellar (Dropbox, Python Software Foundation) and how she
          manages people/teams. Takeaway: “When engineering management is done
          right, you’re focusing on three big things … You’re directly
          supporting the people on your team; you’re managing execution and
          coordination across teams; and you’re stepping back to observe and
          evolve the broader organization and its processes as it grows.”

          as the most important ones that helped me and the team get unstuck and
          get moving: build trust (quickly) and keep the team engaged once that
          trust is in place.” Includes a cheatsheet with additional context on

          - by Lighthouse. Takeaway: “Done well, promoting from within rewards
          and retains your best people for the long term. It also helps
          strengthen your culture. However, if you don’t put the effort and
          attention into making those promoted successful, it can backfire
          massively. No one likes working for a leader that doesn’t know what
          they’re doing, and those failing in a new role will feel terrible.”

          an eye for talent, and demonstrate a few other abilities—and you
          haven’t thought of managing people yet—maybe you should, because
          otherwise someone without those skills might do it instead.
