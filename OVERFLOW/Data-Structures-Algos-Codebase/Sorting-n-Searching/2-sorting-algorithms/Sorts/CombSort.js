/**
 * Comb sort improves on bubble sort.
 *
 * The basic idea is to eliminate turtles, or small values
 * near the end of the list, since in a bubble sort these slow the sorting
 * down tremendously. Rabbits, large values around the beginning of the list,
 * do not pose a problem in bubble sort.
 *
 * In bubble sort, when any two elements are compared, they always have a
 * gap (distance from each other) of 1. The basic idea of comb sort is
 * that the gap can be much more than 1. The inner loop of bubble sort,
 * which does the actual swap, is modified such that gap between swapped
 * elements goes down (for each iteration of outer loop) in steps of
 * a "shrink factor" k: [ n/k, n/k2, n/k3, ..., 1 ].
