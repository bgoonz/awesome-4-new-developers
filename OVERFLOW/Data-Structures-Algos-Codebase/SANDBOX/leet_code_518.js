You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money.Write a
function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount.You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.
Example 1:

    Input: amount = 5, coins = [ 1, 2, 5 ]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
    5 = 5
5 = 2 + 2 + 1
5 = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1
5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
Example 2:

    Input: amount = 3, coins = [ 2 ]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.
Example 3:

    Input: amount = 10, coins = [ 10 ]
Output: 1
Note:

    You can assume that

0 <= amount <= 5000
1 <= coin <= 5000
the number of coins is less than 500
the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32 - bit integer

*/
let change = function (amount, coins) {};
