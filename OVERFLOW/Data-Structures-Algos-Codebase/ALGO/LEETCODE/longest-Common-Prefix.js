/* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/description/

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2.
As an example, longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".

/* A> First take the first string of the given array, and split it by ''. That is each separate character.
B> Then compare character by character with the corresponding character of the next string elements of the passed-in array.
C> And I can bring up reduce() method to access the successive strings of the given array.
 */

// My solution
const longestCommonPrefix = (strs) => {
  if (strs.length === 0) {
    return "";
  }

  return strs.reduce((accm, next) => {
    const tmp = accm.split("");
    // This tmp variable remains constant throughout the program, which is the first string element of the array split by ''
    let result = "";

    for (let i = 0; i < tmp.length; i++) {
      if (tmp[i] !== next[i]) {
        break;
      } else result += tmp[i];
    }
    return result;
  });
};

//Alternative Solution - slightly better speed.
const longestCommonPrefixAlt = (strs) => {
  return strs.reduce((prev, next) => {
    let i = 0;
    while (prev[i] && next[i] && prev[i] === next[i]) {
      i++;
    }
    return prev.slice(0, i);
  });
};

let myStr = ["geeks", "geek", "geezer", "geeksforgeeks"];
// console.log(longestCommonPrefix(myStr));

console.time("MySolution");
longestCommonPrefix(myStr);
console.timeEnd("MySolution");

console.log("*******************************");

console.time("Alternative-1");
longestCommonPrefixAlt(myStr);
console.timeEnd("Alternative-1");
