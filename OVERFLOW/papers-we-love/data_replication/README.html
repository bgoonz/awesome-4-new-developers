Nowadays, keeping immutable copies of data is almost inexpensive. One of the advantages of this fact is that it can alleviate the burden of coordinated accesses to the data in the different layers of the SW/HW stack.</li>
<li>:scroll: <a href="a-comprehensive-study-of-convergent-and-communative-replicated-data-types.pdf">A comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types</a> &gt; Eventual consistency aims to ensure that replicas of some mutable shared object converge without foreground synchronisation. We study a principled approach: to base the design of shared data types on some simple formal conditions that are sufficient to guarantee even- tual consistency. We call these types Convergent or Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).</li>
