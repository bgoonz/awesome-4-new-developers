Some resources that may assist in understanding papers in this section:
- Polymerase Chain Reaction ( [a short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KoLnIwoZKU), [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pcr))

---------
* [Molecular Computation of Solutions to Combinatorial Problems](http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/cps296.4/spring04/papers/Adleman94.pdf)
    - An interesting and inspiring approach to solving the (NP-complete) Hamiltonian Graph problem.

* [The chemical basis of morphogenesis](http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf)
    - How we can generate patterns from reaction-diffusion models and how those models apply in real life situations: cells self-organisation and pattern creation.
    - Includes advance mathematical concepts, basic chemistry, basic biology.
    - By Alan Turing

* [A DNA-Based Archival Storage System](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/publications/dnastorage-asplos16.pdf)
    - DNA is a strong candidate for storing data stably for centuries. DNA also has a very high data/volume density (1 exabyte / mmÂ³).
    - This paper describes an algorithm for storing binary data in the form of DNA that is optimized for biochemical reactions.
