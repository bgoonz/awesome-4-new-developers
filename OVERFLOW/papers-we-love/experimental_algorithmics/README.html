<h1 id="experimental-algorithmics">Experimental Algorithmics</h1>
<p>Experimental algorithmics (sometimes also called empirical algorithmics) is the area within computer science that uses empirical methods to study the behaviour of algorithms. It can be used in the analysis of algorithms <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_algorithmics">(Wikipedia)</a>.</p>

<li>:scroll: <a href="a-theoreticians-guide-to-the-experimental-analysis-of-algorithms.pdf">A Theoreticianâ€™s Guide to the Experimental Analysis of Algorithms</a> (David S. Johnson): An exceptionally well-written guide to correctly evaluating algorithms by experimental analysis. The techniques described in this paper do not only apply to theoreticians although the title might lead one to believe so. The examples used in this paper and specifically the method of listing straight-forward principles illustrated by pit-falls and pet peeves make for an excellent must-read for everyone intending to publish experimental algorithm results.</li>
