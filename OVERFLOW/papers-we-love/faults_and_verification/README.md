# Program Faults and Verification

[Fault detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_detection_and_isolation), and [program validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_verification_and_validation), and [formal validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) are highly interrelated topics.  Each deal with proving or disproving the correctness of systems as intended, and the classification of incorrect behavior.
