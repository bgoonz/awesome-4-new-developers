## Mathematics

* :scroll: [The Transcendence of Pi](transcendence-of-pi.pdf) by Steve Mayer

* :scroll: [Tilings](tilings.pdf) by Ardila

  The paper covers a broad swath of the topic on analysis of tiling, and related strategies.

* :scroll: [From Dominoes to Hexagons](from-dominoes-to-hexagons.pdf) by Thurston

  A paper on the generalization of tilings across different base planes.

* :scroll: [Graph Isomorphism and Representation Theory](graph-isomorphism-and-representation-theory.pdf) by Daniel Litt

  The *graph isomorphism problem* shows how to construct graphs using a simple building-block ("basis"). The same method applies to finding different building blocks to construct the same things. This technique can be applied to file systems, greplin, trees, virtual DOM, etc.

  A short paper, it also shows how to use `ùî∞ùî©‚ÇÇ(‚ÑÇ)` as a simple mathematical object that leads into the area of real mathematics‚Äîrepresention theory.

* [Conway's ZIP proof](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/francisweeks.pdf) by George Francis and Jeffrey Weeks

  This paper presents a classification proof: "How can it be that you know something about _all possible_ `X`, even the `xœµX` you haven‚Äôt seen yet?" The well-diagramed discussion requires no calculus, crypto, ML, or dense notation, making it good for most knowledge levels.

* [Packing of Spheres](http://neilsloane.com/doc/Me109.pdf) by N. Sloane

  Discusses the role of E8 & Leech lattices in optimal codes for mathematically-ideal compression. Ikosahedrons, a tool in this investigation, are also presented.

* [Some Underlying Geometric Notions](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf) by Hatcher

  High-Level survey which relates disparate topics, e.g. Platonic solids (A-D-E), Milnor‚Äôs exceptional fibre, and algebra.

* [What is a Young Tableaux?](https://www.ams.org/notices/200702/whatis-yong.pdf) by Alexander Yong

  Young Tableau appear in combinatoric problems, representation theory, and the calculus of Grassmannians. Another common topic is sorting, and smarter ways to organise sub-sorts.


### Topology

* [Applied Algebraic Topology and Sensor Networks](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/preprints/ATSN.pdf) by Robert Ghrist

* :scroll: [Intro to Tropical Algebra Geometry](intro-to-tropical-algebraic-geometry.pdf)

  Recently there have been some papers posted about tropical geometry of neural nets. Tropical is also said to be derived from CS. This is a good introduction.

* [Elements of Algebraic Topology: Sheaves](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/EAT/EATchapter9.pdf) by Ghrist

  Seminal writing on topological structures, from one most lauded books 'Elements of Algebraic Topology'
