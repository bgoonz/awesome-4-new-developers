<p><a href="http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r30.pdf">Reverend Bayes on inference engines: A distributed hierarchical approach</a> - &gt; The paper that began the probabilistic revolution in AI &gt; by showing how several desirable properties of reasoning systems &gt; can be obtained through sound probabilistic inference. &gt; It introduced tree-structured networks as concise representations of &gt; complex probability models, identified conditional independence &gt; relationships as the key organizing principle for uncertain knowledge, &gt; and described an efficient, distributed, exact inference algorithm.</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r156-reprint.pdf">A theory of inferred causation</a> - with Thomas S. Verma. &gt; Introduces minimal-model semantics as a basis for causal discovery, &gt; and shows that causal directionality can be inferred from patterns &gt; of correlations without resorting to temporal information.</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/R218-B-L.pdf">Causal diagrams for empirical research</a> - extended version linked. &gt; Introduces the theory of causal diagrams and its associated do-calculus; &gt; the first (and still the only) mathematical method to enable a &gt; systematic removal of confounding bias in observations.</p>
<p><a href="http://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/pub/stat_ser/r360.pdf">The algorithmization of counterfactuals</a> - &gt; Describes a computational model that explains how humans generate, &gt; evaluate and distinguish counterfactual statements so swiftly and &gt; consistently.</p>
