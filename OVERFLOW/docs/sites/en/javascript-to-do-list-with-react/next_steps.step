Congrats, you just wrote your first JavaScript application! Woohoo!

There is so, so much more to do. If you still have time, here's some other stuff you can try:

* Allow users to delete items forever! The logic for doing so will look a lot like the logic for completing items.
* Allow users to edit descriptions of items that have already been created. You might look into HTML's
contenteditable attribute to help you out!
* Allow users to sort their items by when they were created. This one's tough, but I'm sure you'll figure it out!
* Allow users to create their own lists. You'll have to write lots of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make this work!
