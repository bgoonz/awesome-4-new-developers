<p>Top-notch developers use a variety of techniques to earn that status. Here are some of them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use UPER</li>
<li>Have a Growth Mindset</li>
<li>Defeat Impostor Syndrome</li>
<li>Show Relentless Tenacity</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uper">UPER</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/Lambda-Problem-Solving-Framework">UPER is a <em>problem-solving framework</em></a>.
<ul>
<li>Understand</li>
<li>Plan</li>
<li>Execute (coding)</li>
<li>Reflect</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Always use it on all problems.</li>
<li><strong>The battle is won or lost during <em>Understand</em> and <em>Plan</em>!</strong></li>
<li>Top devs:
<ul>
<li>spend a <em>lot</em> of time on Understand and Plan.</li>
<li>figure out <em>exactly why their code doesn’t work</em> before fixing it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="growth-mindset">Growth Mindset</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every minute you spend working on a hard problem is experience points in the bank.</li>
<li>It’s not getting the solution that builds skill–it’s working hard on the problem.</li>
<li>Every time you succeed, you learn something new. Every time you fail, you learn something new.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="impostor-syndrome">Impostor Syndrome</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every single developer feels like they’re looking at a blank wall when they first see a difficult problem, and they will always be exposed to difficult problems.</li>
<li>They UPER their way out of it</li>
<li>Every single developer struggled with these concepts the first time they encountered them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relentless-tenacity">Relentless Tenacity</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nothing separates your skill level from that of a pro other than number of reps.</li>
<li>“The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.”</li>
<li>Low-end developers fail and quit. Top developers fail and fail and fail and fail and never quit.</li>
</ul>
