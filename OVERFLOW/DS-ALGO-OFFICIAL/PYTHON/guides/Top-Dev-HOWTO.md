Top-notch developers use a variety of techniques to earn that status. Here are some of them.

* Use UPER
* Have a Growth Mindset
* Defeat Impostor Syndrome
* Show Relentless Tenacity

## UPER

* [UPER is a _problem-solving framework_](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/Lambda-Problem-Solving-Framework).
  * Understand
  * Plan
  * Execute (coding)
  * Reflect
* Always use it on all problems.
* **The battle is won or lost during _Understand_ and _Plan_!**
* Top devs:
  * spend a _lot_ of time on Understand and Plan.
  * figure out _exactly why their code doesn't work_ before fixing it.

## Growth Mindset

* Every minute you spend working on a hard problem is experience points in the bank.
* It's not getting the solution that builds skill--it's working hard on the problem.
* Every time you succeed, you learn something new. Every time you fail, you learn something new.

## Impostor Syndrome

* Every single developer feels like they're looking at a blank wall when they first see a difficult problem, and they will always be exposed to difficult problems.
* They UPER their way out of it
* Every single developer struggled with these concepts the first time they encountered them.

## Relentless Tenacity

* Nothing separates your skill level from that of a pro other than number of reps.
* "The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried."
* Low-end developers fail and quit. Top developers fail and fail and fail and fail and never quit.
