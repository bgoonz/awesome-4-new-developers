## Syntax

arr.every(callback(element\[, index\[, array\]\])\[, thisArg\])

### Parameters

`callback`

A function to test for each element, taking three arguments:

`element`

The current element being processed in the array.

`index` Optional

The index of the current element being processed in the array.

`array` Optional

The array `every` was called upon.

`thisArg` Optional

A value to use as `this` when executing `callback` .

### Return value

**`true`** if the `callback` function returns a [truthy](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/en-US/docs/Glossary/truthy) value for every array element. Otherwise, **`false`**.

## Description

The `every` method executes the provided `callback` function once for each element present in the array until it finds the one where `callback` returns a [falsy](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/en-US/docs/Glossary/falsy) value. If such an element is found, the `every` method immediately returns `false` . Otherwise, if `callback` returns a [truthy](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/en-US/docs/Glossary/truthy) value for all elements, `every` returns `true` .

**Caution**: Calling this method on an empty array will return `true` for any condition!

`callback` is invoked only for array indexes which have assigned values. It is not invoked for indexes which have been deleted, or which have never been assigned values.

`callback` is invoked with three arguments: the value of the element, the index of the element, and the Array object being traversed.

If a `thisArg` parameter is provided to `every` , it will be used as callback's `this` value. Otherwise, the value `undefined` will be used as its `this` value. The `this` value ultimately observable by `callback` is determined according to [the usual rules for determining the `this` seen by a function](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this).

`every` does not mutate the array on which it is called.

The range of elements processed by `every` is set before the first invocation of `callback` . Therefore, `callback` will not run on elements that are appended to the array after the call to `every` begins. If existing elements of the array are changed, their value as passed to `callback` will be the value at the time `every` visits them. Elements that are deleted are not visited.

`every` acts like the "for all" quantifier in mathematics. In particular, for an empty array, it returns `true` . (It is [vacuously true](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth) that all elements of the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set#Properties) satisfy any given condition.)

## Polyfill

`every` was added to the ECMA-262 standard in the 5th edition, and it may not be present in other implementations of the standard. You can work around this by inserting the following code at the beginning of your scripts, allowing use of `every` in implementations which do not natively support it.

This algorithm is exactly the one specified in ECMA-262, 5th edition, assuming `Object` and `TypeError` have their original values, and that `callbackfn.call` evaluates to the original value of [ `Function.prototype.call` ](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call).

    if (!Array.prototype.every) {
      Array.prototype.every = function(callbackfn, thisArg) {
        'use strict';
        var T, k;

        if (this == null) {
          throw new TypeError('this is null or not defined');
        }



        var O = Object(this);




        var len = O.length >>> 0;


        if (typeof callbackfn !== 'function' && Object.prototype.toString.call(callbackfn) !== '[object Function]') {
          throw new TypeError();
        }


        if (arguments.length > 1) {
          T = thisArg;
        }


        k = 0;


        while (k < len) {

          var kValue;







          if (k in O) {
            var testResult;


            kValue = O[k];





            if(T) testResult = callbackfn.call(T, kValue, k, O);
            else testResult = callbackfn(kValue,k,O)


            if (!testResult) {
              return false;
            }
          }
          k++;
        }
        return true;
      };
    }

## Examples

### Testing size of all array elements

The following example tests whether all elements in the array are bigger than 10.

    function isBigEnough(element, index, array) {
      return element >= 10;
    }
    [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(isBigEnough);
    [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(isBigEnough);

### Using arrow functions

[Arrow functions](chrome-extension://cjedbglnccaioiolemnfhjncicchinao/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) provide a shorter syntax for the same test.

    [12, 5, 8, 130, 44].every(x => x >= 10);
    [12, 54, 18, 130, 44].every(x => x >= 10);

### Affecting Initial Array (modifying, appending, and deleting)

The following examples tests the behaviour of the `every` method when the array is modified.

    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    arr.every( (elem, index, arr) => {
      arr[index+1] -= 1
      console.log( `[${arr}][${index}] -> ${elem}` )
      return elem < 2
    })











    arr = [1, 2, 3];
    arr.every( (elem, index, arr) => {
      arr.push('new')
      console.log( `[${arr}][${index}] -> ${elem}` )
      return elem < 4
    })










    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    arr.every( (elem, index, arr) => {
      arr.pop()
      console.log( `[${arr}][${index}] -> ${elem}` )
      return elem < 4
    })
