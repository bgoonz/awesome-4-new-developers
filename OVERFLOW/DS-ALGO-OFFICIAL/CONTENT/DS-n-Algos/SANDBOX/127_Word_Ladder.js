// Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:

// Only one letter can be changed at a time
// Each intermediate word must exist in the word list
// For example,

// Given:
// beginWord = "hit"
// endWord = "cog"
// wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
// As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
// return its length 5.

// Note:
// Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
// All words have the same length.
// All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

Hi Thiago

I very much appreciate that you took the time writing this warm welcoming letter and provided me the opportunity to come onsite visiting the team at Periscope.
After much thought, I've decided to accept offer at another company. It was really a tough call for me since I really like the product, role and people I met during my visit. 
Again, I cannot thank you enough for your time, and support. It's been a great pleasure to know you and the team. I hope that we cross paths in the near future.

Wish you, teams, and Periscope all the success.

Regards,
Jerry
