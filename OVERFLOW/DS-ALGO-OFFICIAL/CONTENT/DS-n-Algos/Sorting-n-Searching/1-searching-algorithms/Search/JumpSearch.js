/* The Jump Search algorithm allows to combine a linear search with a speed optimization.
 * This means that instead of going 1 by 1, we will increase the step of √n and increase that
 * step of √n which make the step getting bigger and bigger.
 * The asymptotic analysis of Jump Search is o(√n). Like the binary search, it needs to be sorted.
 * The advantage against binary search is that Jump Search traversed back only once.
