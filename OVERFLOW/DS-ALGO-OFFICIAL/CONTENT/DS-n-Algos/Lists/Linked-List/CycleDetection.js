  Problem Statement:
  Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

  Note:
  * While Solving the problem in given link below, don't use main() function.
  * Just use only the code inside main() function.
  * The purpose of using main() function here is to aviod global variables.
