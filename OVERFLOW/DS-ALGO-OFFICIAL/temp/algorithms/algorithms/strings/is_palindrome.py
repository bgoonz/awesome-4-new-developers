"""
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome,
considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.
For example,
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome.
"race a car" is not a palindrome.
Note:
Have you consider that the string might be empty?
This is a good question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem,
we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Here is a bunch of other variations of is_palindrome function.

Variation 1:
Find the reverse of the string and compare it with the original string

Variation 2:
Loop from the start to length/2 and check the first character and last character
and so on... for instance s[0] compared with s[n-1], s[1] == s[n-2]...

Variation 3:
Using stack idea. 

Note: We are assuming that we are just checking a one word string. To check if a complete sentence
