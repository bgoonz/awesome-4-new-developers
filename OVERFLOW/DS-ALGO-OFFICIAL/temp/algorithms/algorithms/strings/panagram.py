"""
Given a string, check whether it is a panagram or not.

A panagram is a sentence that uses every letter at least once.

The most famous example is: "he quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

Note:
A panagram in one language isn't necessarily a panagram in another. This
module assumes the english language. Hence, the Finnish panagram
'Törkylempijävongahdus' won't pass for a panagram despite being considered
a perfect panagram in its language. However, the Swedish panagram
'Yxmördaren Julia Blomqvist på fäktning i Schweiz' will pass despite
including letters not used in the english alphabet. This is because the
Swedish alphabet only extends the Latin one.
