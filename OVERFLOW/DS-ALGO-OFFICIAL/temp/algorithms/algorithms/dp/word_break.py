"""
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict
containing a list of non-empty words,
determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated
sequence of one or more dictionary words.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

For example, given
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
