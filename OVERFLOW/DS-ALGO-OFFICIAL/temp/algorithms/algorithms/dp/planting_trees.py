"""
An even number of trees are left along one side of a country road. You've been assigned the job to
plant these trees at an even interval on both sides of the road. The length L and width W of the road
are variable, and a pair of trees must be planted at the beginning (at 0) and at the end (at L) of
the road. Only one tree can be moved at a time. The goal is to calculate the lowest amount of
distance that the trees have to be moved before they are all in a valid position.

    Returns the minimum distance that trees have to be moved before they are all in a valid state.

        Parameters:
            tree (list<int>): A sorted list of integers with all trees' position along the road.
            L (int): An integer with the length of the road.
            W (int): An integer with the width of the road.
