"""
This Prim's Algorithm Code is for finding weight of minimum spanning tree
of a connected graph.
For argument graph, it should be a dictionary type
such as
graph = {
    'a': [ [3, 'b'], [8,'c'] ],
    'b': [ [3, 'a'], [5, 'd'] ],
    'c': [ [8, 'a'], [2, 'd'], [4, 'e'] ],
    'd': [ [5, 'b'], [2, 'c'], [6, 'e'] ],
    'e': [ [4, 'c'], [6, 'd'] ]
}

where 'a','b','c','d','e' are nodes (these can be 1,2,3,4,5 as well)
