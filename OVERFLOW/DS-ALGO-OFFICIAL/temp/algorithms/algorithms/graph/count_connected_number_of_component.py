# count connected no of component using DFS
"""
In graph theory, a component, sometimes called a connected component, 
of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any 
two vertices are connected to each other by paths.

Example:


    1                3------------7
    |
    |
    2--------4
    |        |
    |        |              output = 2
    6--------5
