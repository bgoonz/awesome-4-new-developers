"""
Elias γ code or Elias gamma code is a universal code encoding positive integers.
It is used most commonly when coding integers whose upper-bound cannot be determined beforehand.
Elias δ code or Elias delta code is a universal code encoding the positive integers,
that includes Elias γ code when calculating.
Both were developed by Peter Elias.
