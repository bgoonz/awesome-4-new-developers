Description
    The Koch snowflake is a fractal curve and one of the earliest fractals to
    have been described. The Koch snowflake can be built up iteratively, in a
    sequence of stages. The first stage is an equilateral triangle, and each
    successive stage is formed by adding outward bends to each side of the
    previous stage, making smaller equilateral triangles.
    This can be achieved through the following steps for each line:
        1. divide the line segment into three segments of equal length.
        2. draw an equilateral triangle that has the middle segment from step 1
        as its base and points outward.
        3. remove the line segment that is the base of the triangle from step 2.
    (description adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake )
    (for a more detailed explanation and an implementation in the
    Processing language, see  https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/
