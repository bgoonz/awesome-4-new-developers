Problem:

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2'11 and 3'7 is not difficult, as any
calculator would confirm that 2^11 = 2048 < 3^7 = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382^518061 > 519432^525806 would be much more difficult, as
both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using base_exp.txt, a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent
pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
