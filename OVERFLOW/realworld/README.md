### See how *the exact same* Medium.com clone (called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io)) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because **they all adhere to the same [API spec](spec/)** üòÆüòé

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

RealWorld solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular 2, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called "[Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io)".

# Implementations

Over 100 implementations have been created using various languages, libraries, and frameworks.

[**See the list of implementations on the CodebaseShow website >>>**](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld)

# Create a new implementation

[**Create a new implementation >>>**](/spec)

Or you can [view upcoming implementations (WIPs)](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/discussions/categories/wip-implementations).

# How do I get up & running?

Follow the instructions in the README of whatever frontend and/or backend repo's you want to get up and running.

### Can you teach me how to build each stack from scratch?

Yup! We've built step-by-step tutorials for all of our stacks that teach you how to go from `git init` all the way to the production ready application. [**Start learning now >>>**](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/fullstack)

# Community created resources

# Special thanks to...

RealWorld wouldn't be possible without the help of the open source community reviewing codebases, creating new app implementations, and many other tasks that help push this project forward. We especially appreciate the OSS leaders who have helped contribute to RealWorld:

- **Dan Abramov** (creator of Redux) for  helping [spark the initial idea](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/692009757775896577), [getting the Redux community involved](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1353), as well as graciously taking the time to provide feedback on the Redux codebase
- **Max Lynch** (creator of Ionic) for taking the time to provide guidance in the early days of this project
- **Addy Osmani** (creator of TodoMVC) for helping [spark the initial idea](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/762828483433144320) and his amazing work with TodoMVC
- **TodoMVC** ([team & contributors](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc#team)) for their exemplary & successful work; their project & org has been an invaluable analogy for us as we've built out RealWorld
- **James Brewer** (docs contributor to Django) for countless brainstorming sessions, helping name this project, and creating the Django codebase + tutorial
