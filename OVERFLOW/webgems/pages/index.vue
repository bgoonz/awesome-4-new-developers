      span ðŸ’Ž webgems?
    p webgems is a goto place for devs and designers to find new resources and more. As a beginner, it's sometimes not easy to find what you need since you don't know where to look for what.
    p Therefore we created this project to have the most common and best resources for beginners and veterans in one place â€” kind of like a bookmarks list for devs and designers, containing only the best gems out there.
    p If you want to add your gem, go ahead and open a pull request on GitHub (click on that octocat at the top right corner).
    p By the way, this project lives by getting shared; if you find this worthy, please share it with others.
