      As a collaborator you are representing the Awesome PHP project to the
      community. Please adhere to the following guidelines to give everyone the
      best experience possible:
    </p>
    <h2 id="etiquette">Etiquette</h2>
    <p>
      Please adhere to the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md"
        >CODE-OF-CONDUCT</a
      >
      when reviewing suggestions and participating in discussions on the
      project’s Github account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always be polite and thank people, even if you don’t accept their
      suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are welcome to suggest projects that you are personally involved with,
      or those of friends, family or colleagues, but you are not allowed to
      review or merge them yourself, nor should you request that others do so
      for you. They must be reviewed by a neutral collaborator in their own
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you provide feedback on a suggested project please be friendly and
      constructive.
    </p>
    <h2 id="reviewing">Reviewing</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Tag pull requests with the most relevant label(s).</li>
      <li>
        Validate URLs work correctly and don’t point to anything malicious.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensure suggestions adhere to
        <a
          href="https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h2>
    <p>
      If you have an idea on how to improve the project, please open a ticket
      for discussion using the <code>Enhancement</code> label. Please don’t make
      any broad or sweeping changes without consulting other collaborators first
      and reaching a consensus.
