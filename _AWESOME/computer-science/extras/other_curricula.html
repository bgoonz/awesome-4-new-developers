      OSSU is one of a few efforts to inform learners how they can pursue
      computer science independently. Below are a few other such efforts.

      What differentiates OSSU? OSSU is dedicated to how an individual can learn
      the undergraduate CS curriculum. This is why we use the
      <a href="../CURRICULAR_GUIDELINES.md">CS2013</a> as our curricular
      guidelines. These guidelines are written by the two foremost professional
      organizations in computing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach has the benefit of clarifying to others the extent of a
      studentâ€™s study and understanding. Students have gone from OSSU study into
      both tech industry employment and into Computer Science graduate school.
      We look forward to helping you do the same.
