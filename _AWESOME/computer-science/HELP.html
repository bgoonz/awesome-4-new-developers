      Join the OSSU <a href="https://discord.gg/5pUhfpX">Discord server</a>!
      Discord is an online chat service, similar to Slack or IRC where you can
      chat with other students and get help. ### Specific problems If you need
      help successfully completing the content of a course or are having general
      technical difficulties, first reach out to the resources provided by the
      course (e.g.Â the course forum on Coursera, edX, etc). If you need
      additional help after that, post in Discord.
      <strong
        >In your post, mention what steps you have already taken to try and
        solve the problem</strong
      >. ### General problems If you have general problems with the program not
      specific to any course, such as preferring textbook-style learning over
      MOOCs, Discord is a good place to reach out to people who may have great
      suggestions. You might form a working group that makes the next
      improvement to OSSU CS! Read more about contributing
