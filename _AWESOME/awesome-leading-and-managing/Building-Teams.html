            Thumbtack’s CEO Help</a
          >
          - by FirstRound Capital. Takeaway: Constrain the job description,
          split your interview process to separate skill assessment from fit,
          backchannel to assess skill, and present results of references and
          swap 360s.

          <a href="https://noidea.dog/glue">Being Glue</a> - by Tanya Reilly.
          Takeaway: “Every senior person in an organisation should be aware of
          the less glamorous - and often less-promotable - work that needs to
          happen to make a team successful. Managed deliberately, glue work
          demonstrates and builds strong technical leadership skills. Left
          unconscious, it can be career limiting. It can push people into less
          technical roles and even out of the industry.”

          - by Bill DeRusha. Takeaway: How the edX internationalization team
          spun up quickly—team charter, communication, building a relationship
          with the product manager, being clear and focused about the project
          scope, and communicating. Includes links to articles about creating
          team charters.

          >
          - by Jason Wong. Takeaway: “A First Team mindset is the idea that
          leaders prioritize supporting their fellow leaders over supporting
          their direct reports—that they are responsible to their peers more
          than they are to their individual teams.”

            >Building and Scaling a Distributed and Inclusive Team</a

          (video) - by Mathias Meyer. The founder/CEO of Travis CI talks about
          how the company has been trying to create a multicultural distributed
          team, with lots of quotes from team members. Travis pushed for a
          remote culture to increase diversity.

          (video) - by Richard Kasperowski. Takeaway: Thoughts on psychological
          safety and creating authentic trust and connection between people to
          take the “luck” out of building and working on great teams, and making
          greatness more intentional.

            Attract New Talent</a
          >
          - by Andrew Hao. Takeaway: Start with evaluating your current
          culture’s strengths and weaknesses. Be in tune with your org. Make
          sure you demonstrate that you value employees—whether that is talking
          up their accomplishments, investing in training, or just being there
          to talk.

            >DevOps Tech: Empowering Teams to Choose Tools</a
          >
          - by the DORA State of DevOps research program. Takeaway: “[W]hen you
          combine tool choice with other capabilities—for example, a full view
          of the system, fast feedback, and the understanding that they are
          responsible for the code that they write—it helps your technologists
          make wise decisions about tools they will use and need to support.”

            “Corporate”</a
          >
          - by Avi Revivo. Takeaway: “Finding the sweet spot in the organization
          where you utilize exactly the right amount of processes is practically
          impossible. Sometimes you’ll use a process that provides less value
          than what it cost and sometimes the opposite. It means that you need
          to remember the 3 questions - Can we achieve the same goal without a
          process? or with an even simpler one? Is the process ROI positive?
          What is the chance of a successful adoption of the process and
          why?…and consider them for each new process but you’ll also need to
          ask the first 2 questions on exciting processes every now and then to
          make sure it stands the test of time.”

            >The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: a Leadership Fable</a
          >
          - by Patrick Lencioni. Takeaway: lack of trust and commitment, fear of
          conflict, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results will
          prevent your team from gelling and performing. This book uses a
          narrative/fictional case study to make its point about overcoming the
          five dysfunctions.

            with John Cutler</a
          >
          - by Dottie Schrock. Takeaway: “[P]roduct teams must figure out how to
          regain control over the flywheel of making and keeping promises. It’s
          easy to talk philosophically about trust and culture, but it is your
          day-to-day actions that actually build goodwill.”

            >Great Development Teams Have a Culture of Discipline</a
          >
          - by Erran Berger. Takeaway: Value craftsmanship as highly as you
          value execution; attack each problem you face with a tremendous sense
          of urgency; instrument everything - you can’t fix what you don’t
          measure; fewer things done better - the disciplined pursuit of less;
          be rigorous in prioritization and planning; establish a high hiring
          bar – you’re creating an enduring culture.

            >Growing a Feature Team Using Lanes</a
          >
          - by Vivian Pennel. Takeaway: using a “fast lane” for handling “small
          requests, features or bugs that need to be executed quickly” and
          protecting “the strategic lane,” the high-value work. Also use a tech
          lane for paying back debt, updating libraries and components.

            Collaboration</a
          >
          - by Angela Robertson. Takeaway: An honest account of transforming the
          technical content team of Microsoft’s Cloud and Enterprise group from
          closed and uncollaborative to open and transparent. Finding purpose in
          openness was key.

          >
          - by Duretti Hirpa. Takeaway: Good teams are supportive, have a sense
          of togetherness and don’t blame their team members for their mistakes
          but instead learn from them.

          - by Jürgen Appelo at M3.0. Takeaway: Personal maps and group
          exercises to develop them can enable members of teams to get to know
          each other as <em>humans</em> with interests and hobbies. The article
          points to tips and case stories for you to get ideas.

          >
          - by Randall Koutnik. Takeaway: “Any programmer worth their salt is
          willing to help team members out when they’re in a pinch. Software
          development is a team sport, after all. Unfortunately, management can
          often completely miss the point and create perverse incentives that
          wreck a team’s cooperation and communication.”

          >
          - by Lawrence Ripsher. Takeaway: “To effectively manage less
          experienced team members, provide a clear explanation of HOW to
          implement/approach something. For mid-career/experience individuals,
          provide a clear explanation WHAT needs to be built/implemented. For
          the most skilled / experienced, you need only explain WHY a solution
          is important.”

          >
          - by Aaron Dignan. Takeaway: This framework (available as a PDF)
          presents a canvas for building your organization, with 12 concepts:
          purpose, authority, structure, strategy, resources, innovation,
          workflow, meetings, information, membership, mastery and compensation.

          >
          - by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: “Reorgs are unlikely to solve all of
          your problems overnight. They are not a magic bullet exercise that
          fixes cultural issues or a lack of business strategy. If you aren’t
          careful, your reorg will feel like rearranging deck chairs on the
          Titanic, a pointless waste of time for everyone involved. So don’t be
          afraid to do them as necessary, but be realistic. This is a major
          disruption that impacts everyone, don’t just do it for fun.”

          reorg so you can prepare for your own.

            Scaling Your Team?</a
          >
          - by Oren Ellenbogen. Takeaway: The five traits of a scalable team are
          1. and aligned vision, 2. aligned, core values, 3. core values over
          individuals, 4. self-balance, and 5. having a sense of accomplishment.

          >
          - by Ian Cackett and Sasha Bilton. Takeaway: “In the longer-term,
          there can be a lost opportunity for synergy between autonomous squads;
          opportunities to introduce common structure or shared solutions.
          Having many solutions to the same problem spells wasted effort, less
          focus on the quality of each implementation and an increased
          likelihood of bugs creeping in.”

          practical research Google has done around building effective teams. He
          addresses not only the research, but the insights of a manager who
          worked with his own team and others, to instill the findings and
          principles in the real world, along with key insights from Google’s
          pilot program.
