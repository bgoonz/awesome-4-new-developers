          >
          - by Rands. Takeaway: “A meeting has two critical components: an
          agenda and a referee … A meeting’s progress is measured by the flow,
          and the referee’s job is keep it moving along at a good clip, which is
          why the referee sometimes needs to own it,” or improvise. “If you must
          meet, start the meeting by remembering the definition of a successful
          meeting is that when the meeting is done, it need never occur again.”

          >
          - by Maya Bernstein and Rae Ringel. Takeaway: “Start by putting your
          own expertise and agenda aside and thinking about the people who will
          be affected by your meeting. Develop empathy for them by asking three
          sets of questions: Who is going to be in the room and what are their
          needs? Who won’t be in the room but will nevertheless be affected by
          the meeting and what are their needs? In what broader culture and
          environment are you operating and what are some of the overarching
          challenges and opportunities?” Then, frame the meeting; design it; and
          test-drive the plan.

          >
          - by Steve Sinofsky. Takeaway: “This essay does not contain the
          magical PowerPoint template for how to run an effective meeting, nor
          does it espouse a system for deciding how, when, or why to meet. I’ve
          seen every type of agenda, preparation, tracking, issue-list,
          decision-making tool, template (whether using Word, Excel, Powerpoint,
          or Outlook). Call me skeptical. In my experience the best tool for
          meetings is scheduling time to have them in the first place and then
          to be present. The rest are just distractions to the real goals of
          sharing, building, deciding.”

          answers to ensure a meeting is productive.

          - by Simon Cockayne. Takeaway: Avoid back-to-back scheduling; unclear
          purpose; lack of preparation; multitasking; personality-based judging
          of ideas; running over time; zero followup.

          >
          - by Jimmy Sjölund. Takeaways: People tend to “default” to 60-minute
          meetings, but most meetings rarely require this much time. Sjölund
          offers six suggestions for trimming meetings to a more manageable and
          appropriate length while simulatenously making them more effective.

            >Start Every Meeting with a Personal Check-in</a
          >
          - by Mathias Meyer. Takeaway: the Travis CI CEO talks about how
          meditation has enhanced his ability to be present, and how this
          carries into team meetings. “Before you walk into a meeting (virtually
          or into the meeting room), close your eyes, inhale three times, and
          walk in. I found that this can have a great impact on my presence and
          focus in meetings.” The team starts meetings with the red/yellow/green
          scale and everyone states how they’re feeling.

            >Three-Day No-Meeting Schedule for Engineers</a
          >
          - by Pinterest Engineering. Takeaway: “Obviously there are trade-offs
          when making a change like this. However, we [at Pinterest] feel that
          three focused days with two days of meetings is better than scattered
          meetings throughout the week. The survey results also indicate that
          the majority of engineers share that sentiment.”

            >What I Hear When You Tell Me Your Company Doesn’t Do Meetings</a
          >
          - by Johnathan Nightingale. Takeaway: “When you tell me your company
          doesn’t do meetings, this is what I hear[:] You don’t understand the
          privilege of executive context … you also undervalue narrative and
          alignment [and] ou don’t know how to run an effective meeting.” Four
          questions to ask when planning a meeting: “Who is running this
          meeting?; What is the output of this meeting?; Who are the right
          people to produce that output?; How are we going to get to that
          output?”
