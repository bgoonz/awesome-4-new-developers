            Manager Instead.</a
          >
          - by Osman (Ozzie) Ahmed Osman. Takeaway: Consider that your manager
          is unaware of their behavior, afraid of failure, or has some other
          valid-to-them reason for micromanaging. But they might also have
          control issues. Try to take control back by starting a conversation
          with feedback, using the SBI model. If it doesn’t go well, consider
          leaving the manager or team for another.

            <strong>Money:</strong> When you don’t pay people well enough, you
            contribute to undermining their resilience in the face of problems
            at work. Think of it as the baseline of

          <li>
            <strong>Purpose:</strong> There are always technical challenges to
            be found in organizations, but you’re probably not building a
            company with a bunch of insanely hard tech problems. This means you
            have to work harder to sell the learning opportunities. Let
            engineers into the non-technical decision-making processes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Respect:</strong> Respect that engineers are smart
            individuals who often have more to add to your business than just
            their coding talents. Teach them to respect that the other parts of
            the business have equally valuable skills and perspectives.
            Engineers don’t need to feel like the company royalty to be inspired
            to do good work, but they do need the opportunity to be treated like
            a partner.

          >
          - by David Lynch. Takeaway: “Getting the maximum impact from everyone
          on your team, and growing their potential for impact over time, is
          perhaps the most important thing a manager can do, but it can also be
          one of the hardest. Here’s a simple way you can do that.” The simple
          way is to get your people to focus and build upon their strengths
          instead of their weaknesses, and to do it from a team-context
          perspective. Four skills areas to focus on: “leadership, expert
          execution, strategy and planning and cultural alignment.”

          Bad ones hinder us. Either way, habits powerfully influence our
          automatic behavior.”

          Autonomy: the urge to direct our own lives. Mastery: the desire to get
          better and better at something that matters. Purpose: yearning to do
          something larger than ourselves—e.g., hospital janitor as “ambassador”
          or “promote healing by creating sterile places.”

        because of their manager. Employees want daily face time from their
        manager, and regular meetings.
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <strong>Business Motivated:</strong> Driven most by a desire to get
            things done for the customer; have a can-do attitude. In terms of
            code, they think more concretely, and aren’t always the best at
            creating abstractions that support reuse or other non-functional
            goals. They just want to get things done and see a functional
            product.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technology Motivated:</strong> Love learning new things for
            its own sake; eager to find the newest framework, language, or
            methodology and will take every opportunity to try it out on their
            current project. Know all the trending technologies, and have
            probably dabbled with them over nights and weekends. On a greenfield
            project they thrive, but when the field turns “brown” and new code
            turns into legacy, they look for greener pastures, or—possibly
            worse—seek ways to shoehorn in technology even if it’s to the
            detriment of the system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Problem Motivated:</strong> Hard problems excite these
            developers, independent of which technology is employed or even if
            it adds value for the business. It’s all about the puzzle. Coming up
            with an elegant, clever, or quality solution is the victory. While
            their solutions are solid, sometimes the details slip.

          Look for people who “will push you out of your comfort zone; have
          different levels of experience than you (both more experience, and
          less experience); have experience in a different industry; are good at
          the things that you’re terrible at.”

          tries to trick you into telling them what to do, take the time to ask
          them what they think you should do. Then be quiet and listen. With
          time, these incremental changes will have a profound impact not only
          on your organization’s effectiveness, but on the lives of its people.”

          work isn’t very engaging; or when opportunities for continued growth
          and expanding competencies are too limited or blocked. It’s time we
          recognize the negative psychological impact that the management
          culture and the ‘requirements’ for success can have on people and the
          organizations they work for. They exist at great cost to both.”

            >The 4 ‘Perks’ Good Developers Really Want</a
          >
          - by Mike Melnicki. Takeaway: The best developers “want to have an
          impact in all aspects of the company: product direction, marketing,
          human resources, design and even finance.” The other three: Allow your
          devs to build a personal brand; create opportunities for them to
          demonstrate creativity; and consider the unique needs of your team
          members, and support them with flexibility.

          - by unspecified Lighthouse blog writer. Takeaway: There are still
          opportunities for employees even if promotion is not currently an
          option. Lateral moves, and specific skills focus can help retain
          folks. Tapping into intrinsic motivations can help with engagement.

          - by DHH. Takeaway: “There are no negotiated salaries or raises at
          Basecamp. Everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the
          same. Equal work, equal pay.” Basecamp offers employees salaries in
          the top 5% of the market (Chicago) and meaningful benefits, and has
          instituted a new profit growth sharing scheme.

          >
          - by Adi Oz. Takeaway: Oz created the Pizza Model after becoming a
          manager and watching half of the engineers leave due to company
          culture. The model includes four needs: social, (work-life) balance,
          profession and salary. Every person rates these factors on a different
          scale.

          - by Rich Archebold. Takeaway: Avoid manager overconfidence by asking
          for advice and peer review, owning instead of blaming, give feedback
          with empathy, savor success, and constantly revisit what it takes to
          be a good manager.

          - by Kate Heddleston. Takeaway: “You can retain any employee by
          valuing them equal to their work, training managers at your company,
          and giving employees the benefits and work flexibility to manage life
          outside the office. I wish we valued retaining underrepresented groups
          as much as we valued hiring them.”

          job during the previous three years. “Workplace culture drives
          turnover, significantly affecting the retention of underrepresented
          groups, and costing the industry more than $16 billion each year.”

          >
          - by George Dickson, Bonusly. Takeaway: surprising stats and context
          about retention, from “35% of employees said they’d look for a new job
          if they do not receive a pay raise in the next year” to “93% of
          millennials say they left their employer the last time they changed
          roles.”

          Aflac CEO Dan Amos worked with a team that was 70% women. His
          company’s approach to reducing turnover, he just asked employees what
          they wanted. It produced results.

          - by Ryan Pendell. Takeaway: “Organizations that rely on world-class
          talent must find more creative ways of re-recruiting their top
          performers, even when traditional incentives (i.e., pay and
          promotions) are not immediately available.”

          >
          - by Jennifer Robison for Gallup. Takeaway: “According to Gallup’s
          research, 9 of the 12 workplace elements consistently predict turnover
          across business units, regardless of an organization’s size. These
          elements are: having clear expectations, having the materials and
          equipment to do the job right, having the opportunity to do what you
          do best every day, the belief that someone at work cares, the belief
          that someone encourages your development, a sense that your opinions
          count, the mission or purpose of the company making you feel that your
          job is important, a belief that your coworkers are committed to
          quality, and having opportunities to learn and grow at work. If these
          needs are met, as shown by higher scores on these employee engagement
          items, turnover is likely to be low.”

          - by George Dickson at Bonusly. Takeaway: “Start by taking a step back
          and objectively analyzing the causes of voluntary turnover.
          Understanding why top performers quit is the first step in preventing
          yours from leaving for greener pastures. Luckily, you don’t have to
          make these mistakes yourself to learn from them. Plenty of others
          already have.”

          >
          - by Ron Carucci. Takeaway: “Motivation is not something you do to
          people. People ultimately choose to be motivated — when to give their
          best, go the extra mile, and offer radical ideas. The only thing
          leaders can do is shape the conditions under which others do, or
          don’t, choose to be motivated. But the final choice is theirs.”

          >
          - by Mianya Ong. Takeaway: Ong rejects in managers the “their way or
          the highway” attitude, being busy being too busy, lack of awareness of
          what reports are working on, infallibiity, inability to explain why,
          hiring people exactly like them, and inability to compromise.

          >
          - by Nicole Sanchez. Takeaway: Bad managers, HR isn’t trusted/can’t do
          its job well; misalignment; your company treats people like tools; the
          CEO is underperforming instead of working; your approach to hiring
          senior leadership looks more like cronyism than rigorous selection;
          the smartest person in your company is buried deep in the org chart
          and underutilized. But you can fix it.
