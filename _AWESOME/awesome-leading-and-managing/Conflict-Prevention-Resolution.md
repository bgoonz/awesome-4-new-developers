Takeaway: "Brilliant jerks harm team morale and productivity. They don’t have to worry about being nice, because they are the top dog, and people need their natural talent. They have no incentive to try to improve, because they can simply go somewhere else. If you look carefully, you’ll notice that they often bounce around from place to place. They know they can get away with it." You must apply a "no jerks" policy.

"Companies can adopt a 'no asshole rule,' or more politely, a 'no brilliant jerks' policy. Colleagues may be genuinely conflicted about how to deal with [the selfish type of "brilliant jerk"]: on the one hand, he is a real jerk, but on the other he is a 'high performer,' so isn't it in the company's best interest to tolerate his behavior? A policy helps you decide, and it can be as simple as three words: no brilliant jerks."

Takeaway: "One very reliable pattern I’ve observed in a lot of situations is that the strength of people’s emotional response to a statement tells you a lot about how close this statement cuts to their biggest worries. It’s sort of obvious if you say it that way, but if you apply it as a detection method, it’s very powerful: strong responses lead you to where the real problems are, the real threats to people."

Takeaway: "A common mistake I observe in leaders of teams big and small is to aspire for peace as a default. You should be challenging peace as a default. Create an environment where people can withstand a fight and engage in friction as it arises. Rather than passively surf the whims of peoples’ hesitations to take action, bring the conflict to the surface[.]"

- [Learning to Embrace Conflict as a Part of Startup Culture](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/17/learning-to-embrace-conflict-as-a-part-of-startup-culture/) - by Eric Paley. Takeaway: "Ego makes conflict painful because we try to avoid hurting others’ feelings, while protecting our own. But for many, winning the argument becomes more important than the company making the right decision. Therefore, when we engage conflict, we become emotional and want to win for ourselves, confusing this emotion with our desire to win collectively. While each of us struggles with this tension, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that everyone in the debate naturally is subjective on the superior value of their perspective. This tendency can often lead to anger, insecurity, and unnecessary emotion that makes conflict painful, relationship threatening and unproductive. Unfortunately, ego frightens many team members to shift into conflict avoidance."

- [Overcome the 5 Dysfunctions of a Team](https://medium.com/the-mission/part-2-overcome-the-5-dysfunctions-of-a-team-ef922309f8b5) : by The Mission. Takeaway: 1. It takes time to build trust in a team. 2. Never fear conflict, as "the only purpose of productive conflict is to produce the best solution in the shortest period of time." 3. Commitment is a function of two things: clarity and buy-in. Great teams move forward with complete buy-in, including members who voted against the decision. Therefore, leaders must be comfortable with the prospect of making a decision that turns out to be wrong. 4. Leaders must create a culture of accountability in/to the team by encouraging and allowing the team to serve as the first and primary accountability mechanism. 5. Leaders must set the tone for the team to focus on results. If the team members sense that the leader values anything other than results, they will take that as permission to do the same.

Takeaway: "Essentially, the amount you trust someone is the sum of how credible you believe they are on a subject, how reliable they've proven themselves to be over time, and how authentic you think they are as a person, divided by how much you think they're acting in their own self interest. Looking at her colleagues' relationship through this lens, [article subject Anne Raimondi, who's been a Director of Product at eBay, VP Marketing at SurveyMonkey, CRO at TaskRabbit, SVP Operations at Zendesk, and COO at Earnin] helped them diagnose when and how trust had eroded, and eventually work with them to heal the rift."

- [Why We Should Be Disagreeing More at Work](https://hbr.org/2018/01/why-we-should-be-disagreeing-more-at-work) - by Amy Gallo. Takeaway: "[M]ost people don’t want to disagree or know how to do it. In fact, we’ve come to equate saying “I see it differently” or “I don’t agree” with being angry, rude, or unkind, so it makes most people horribly uncomfortable...Disagreements are an inevitable, normal, and healthy part of relating to other people. There is no such thing as a conflict-free work environment. You might dream of working in a peaceful utopia, but it wouldn’t be good for your company, your work, or you. In fact, disagreements — when managed well — have lots of positive outcomes."
