Takeaway: “Writing more code or releasing more features alone doesn’t make you a better senior engineer. It’s about your ability to deliver a meaningful business impact through your execution. This is the change in mindset that will set you on your way to the next level.”

- [Khan Academy Engineering Career Development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qr0d05X5-AsyDYqKRCfgGGcWSshTMd_vfTggfhDpbls/edit) - by Khan Academy. Takeaway: describes the skills, scope, and experience of main engineering job categories, with values emphasised.

- [Open Source Culture](http://whilefalse.blogspot.com/2015/10/open-source-culture.html) - by Camille Fournier. A post on Rent the Runway's engineering ladder, by the company's now-former CTO.

- [Programmer Competency Matrix](http://www.starling-software.com/employment/programmer-competency-matrix.html) - by Starling Software. Great for tech skills, but would need substantial work to capture what it means to be a well-rounded dev ("client focus," "product ownership," etc). We like it for what it is ("technical only").

- [Truth and Consequences of the Technical Track](http://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/11/truth-and-consequences-of-technical.html) - by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: "I think the idealistic goal of management is to help teams live up to their talent potential. The realistic experience of management is often an abstraction layer between upstream and downstream, to help flow information, each layer helping to make a finer-grained set of decisions and adjustments to keep the overall company moving in the right direction."

### Goal-setting

- [Habits to Earn a Raise](https://dev.to/recursivefaults/habits-to-earn-a-raise-ad8) - by Ryan Latta. Takeaway: Get a journal to record your wins, set goals aligned with company goals and follow up, run at problems that everyone else avoids.

- **How to Set Team Goals**: Notes from a Conversation with Joe Goldberg and his Colleague, David Wolpa.

  - Deciding on a goal: Why do people choose to join your org/team?; What goals has the team really rallied around in the past? Why?
  - Look at "paired metrics" from High Output Management, e.g. output + quality-measuring outcomes ($, billable hours), not inputs (utilization, "time spent on tickets")
  - People should have role in determining the goal and setting the target (which should be stretch but be realistic)
  - To what degree is achieving the goal directly under team's control?
  - Communicating a goal: Explain why goal is important to business, esp. when there's a disconnect from day-to-day. Need to do that repeatedly throughout the goal-measurement period. Naming/ritual gets people bought into it (e.g. fundraising thermometer)

- [Lightweight, Continuous Goal-Setting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XRfTZ_tmL-N-Mudu0uniIWmCOycUviXmefbSZ6ZDv1w/edit) - notes by Joe Goldberg.

- [When Mentoring Turns Toxic](https://qz.com/526226/when-mentoring-turns-toxic/) - by Lorraine Duffy Merkl. Takeaway: "In a best-case scenario, mentors induct young people into the traditions of their professions. But this dynamic can set the stage for destructive behavior, McClelland writes. Sometimes mentors try to stamp out daring ideas that threaten long-held principles in their fields. Others may see themselves as “gatekeepers” whose role is to cut upstarts down to size. And basic narcissism may lead mentors to act out when they feel threatened by promising protégés. Mentoring relationships can also go awry when young professionals feel beholden to their advisers."

- [Why The Right Change Often Feels Wrong](http://scottberkun.com/2017/why-the-right-change-often-feels-wrong/) - by Scott Berkun. Takeaway: "Inexperienced people often confuse the chaos phase as a failure in their choice. And if they quit early, assuming “chaos” means they made a mistake, and revert back to the old ways of doing things, they likely will never have the confidence to try something that bold again. They now confuse the chaos phase with failure. This is a kind of self-inflicted learned helplessness, where the necessary cost to improve and grow is now too psychologically expensive. People and organizations can become paralyzed here, as they’ve become extremely resistant to any threat of a 'foreign element,' even though that’s exactly what’s needed to grow."

- [How to Navigate the First 90 Days as the First HR Hire at a Startup](https://tettra.co/culture-codes/interview/how-to-navigate-the-first-90-days-as-the-first-hr-hire-at-a-startup/) - by Culture Codes. Takeaway: A profile of HR veteran Heather Doshay, who as VP of People for a startup aims to build healthy culture.

- [Betterment Tested Three Performance Management Systems So You Don't Have To](http://firstround.com/review/betterment-tested-three-performance-management-systems-so-you-dont-have-to/) - by FirstRound.

It also helps me know our whole team better, and get clear signals from managers that make interactions with each person more meaningful. I highly recommend the practice." Includes a template to get you started.

"Google kept telling me that it couldn’t judge my work until it saw me complete a project. Meanwhile, I couldn’t complete any projects because Google kept interrupting them midway through and assigning me new ones. My career was being dictated by a shifting, anonymous committee who thought about me for an hour of their lives. Management decisions that I had no input into were erasing months of my career progress."

### How to Review Managers

- [Running a Manager Feedback Cycle](https://cate.blog/2017/03/23/running-a-manager-feedback-cycle/) - by Cate Huston. Provides a structured, transparent process for getting feedback as a manager. "It’s hard to get feedback as a manager, the hope was that people would be more candid if they 1) submitted feedback anonymously 2) to someone else. Because we tend to amplify negative feedback, there was a benefit to having someone else go through it, find trends, and repackage it for the recipient."
