        things emerges from the top down, not only by what is celebrated, but by
        what is role modeled.”

        Yoshida, who pointed out that front-line information awareness decreased
        the further up the management hierarchy he went. This article suggests
        that humility, via reaching out to front-line workers to understand

        >
        - by FirstRound Capital. Takeaway: Focusing on James Everingham at
        Instagram. “Everingham soon realized that boosting Instagram’s
        straggling transparency scores meant figuring out what a common
        definition was. And that wasn’t all — he quickly recognized that
        shedding light on the decision-making process would also become a
        sizable component of their efforts to solve the transparency equation.
        The engineering group would need to identify who was making decisions,
        how those decisions were made and why they were being made.”

          - by Ron McFarland. McFarland’s wide-ranging piece outlines various
          meanings of the term “trust,” organizational factors that can
          influence it, and organizational dynamics that it, in turn, affects.
          The piece also includes descriptions of ways trust can operate at

          - by FirstRound. Takeaway: “Too often, upper management thinks that
          sharing about problems confronting the business will heighten anxiety
          among staff, but what’s more anxiety provoking is not knowing. You
          can’t protect your people from hard truths anyway. And holding back
          the truth, or telling them half-truths, will only breed contempt.
          Trust is based on honest communication, and I find that employees
          become cynical when they hear half-truths.”

          - by Paul J. Zak. Takeaway: “[B]uilding a culture of trust is what
          makes a meaningful difference. Employees in high-trust organizations
          are more productive, have more energy at work, collaborate better with
          their colleagues, and stay with their employers longer than people
          working at low-trust companies. They also suffer less chronic stress
          and are happier with their lives, and these factors fuel stronger
          performance.”

          meeting or conversation with the feeling and optimism you’d like to
          have at the start of your next conversation with the person”); give
          your most recent performance review to your final round candidates;
          don’t miss the Day One opportunity; write and distribute your user
          guide; reference the Trust Equation by Steven Drozdeck and Lyn Fisher;

          >
          - by Oren Ellenbogen. Takeaway: “Increasing skill debt is an outcome
          of an organization where trust is deteriorating.” This is because lack
          of trust encourages people to stick to what they already know, instead
          of stretching their skills and knowledge and experimenting. This leads
          to stagnation. Watch out for lack of empathy, disinterest, blame and
          cynicism. Managers and team leads must work together to resolve.
