          >
          - by John Allspaw. Focusing on attributing “Senior” to “Mature”.
          Covers aspects of being social. Mature engineers are at least aware of
          their ego, able to take into account the feelings and egos of their
          fellow engineers, and work through them all to achieve great things.
          This tends to make them engineers that other engineers want to work
          with.

          (“technical only”). You’d need to add the other sections.

          realistic experience of management is often an abstraction layer
          between upstream and downstream, to help flow information, each layer
          helping to make a finer-grained set of decisions and adjustments to
          keep the overall company moving in the right direction.”

        <strong>How to Set Team Goals</strong>: Notes from a Conversation with
        Joe Goldberg and his Colleague, David Wolpa.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Deciding on a goal: Why do people choose to join your org/team?;
            What goals has the team really rallied around in the past? Why?
          </li>
          <li>
            Look at “paired metrics” from High Output Management, e.g. output +
            quality-measuring outcomes ($, billable hours), not inputs
            (utilization, “time spent on tickets”)
          </li>
          <li>
            People should have role in determining the goal and setting the
            target (which should be stretch but be realistic)
          </li>
          <li>
            To what degree is achieving the goal directly under team’s control?
          </li>
          <li>
            Communicating a goal: Explain why goal is important to business,
            esp. when there’s a disconnect from day-to-day. Need to do that
            repeatedly throughout the goal-measurement period. Naming/ritual
            gets people bought into it (e.g. fundraising thermometer)

          - by First Round. Takeaway: How Box SVP Engineering Sam Schillace
          helped the tech organization scale up while valuing performance. Have
          clear standards for performance, have an opinion on the role of
          managers early, have a process for evaluation and reward, don’t be
          soft on low performance, be consistent without losing speed.

          other roles. The program has strengthened diversity efforts and also
          helped employees launch new careers.

            Work</a
          >
          - by First Round. Takeaway: Don’t use the word ‘mentor’, don’t treat
          it like a transaction, show up prepared with questions, don’t discuss
          everything, ask about your blind spots, look for themes and organizing
          principles, be honest and transparent, focus on execution, strive for
          mutual learning, always have several mentors.

            >When Mentoring Turns Toxic</a
          >
          - by Lorraine Duffy Merkl. Takeaway: “In a best-case scenario, mentors
          induct young people into the traditions of their professions. But this
          dynamic can set the stage for destructive behavior, McClelland writes.
          Sometimes mentors try to stamp out daring ideas that threaten
          long-held principles in their fields. Others may see themselves as
          “gatekeepers” whose role is to cut upstarts down to size. And basic
          narcissism may lead mentors to act out when they feel threatened by
          promising protégés. Mentoring relationships can also go awry when
          young professionals feel beholden to their advisers."

            >Why The Right Change Often Feels Wrong</a
          >
          - by Scott Berkun. Takeaway: “Inexperienced people often confuse the
          chaos phase as a failure in their choice. And if they quit early,
          assuming “chaos” means they made a mistake, and revert back to the old
          ways of doing things, they likely will never have the confidence to
          try something that bold again. They now confuse the chaos phase with
          failure. This is a kind of self-inflicted learned helplessness, where
          the necessary cost to improve and grow is now too psychologically
          expensive. People and organizations can become paralyzed here, as
          they’ve become extremely resistant to any threat of a ‘foreign
          element,’ even though that’s exactly what’s needed to grow."

          “Small cracks aren’t always visible or might seem trivial, but if left
          untreated, they can break apart a company.” Surveys, observing
          meetings, scaling good attributes, hiring an HR professional early are
          some techniques companies can use to leverage HR expertise well.

          - by Doug Devlin. Takeaway: “People Operations is based on the simple
          truth: to hold on to your talent, you have to understand and “take
          care” of your talent. Allowing employee choice based on analytics as
          opposed to emotional mandates is the cornerstone of People Operations.

      “We see things not as they are but as we are.” Giving reviews is a place
      where bias lurks. Understand the cognitive bias cheatsheet and mental
      models list and you’ll at least acknowledge that we’re all biased.

          from Eric Elliot. Takeaway: “If you’re not listening closely to the
          employee you’re evaluating, and interviewing their peers about how
          helpful and knowledgable that employee is… And if the sum of that
          feedback is anything less than your primary gauge of performance … You
          SUCK at judging employee performance.”

          into the psychological factors that make or break good calls during
          performance reviews. Gives an overview of common biases, such as the
          fundamental attribution error, confirmation bias, and self-serving
          bias.

          the scope of the level they are operating at, so talk about impact and
          scope almost interchangeably. No matter what level: Good decisions →
          Trust → More responsibility → Impact.

          >
          - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: “How you receive feedback — especially
          negative feedback — sets the precedent for how welcome honest,
          forthcoming perspectives are in your company. Dismiss feedback on a
          whim or become overly defensive, and you’re not likely to hear
          critical feedback from that person again.”

          - by Ben Wigert and Annamarie Mann. Takeaway: Traditional annual
          reviews don’t usually inspire people to perform better because there’s
          often a lack of trust, context and connection to make them useful.
          Better alternatives focus on being achievement-oriented, fair and
          accurate, and developmental. Consider calling them “progress reviews”
          to make them more encouraging.

          making assumptions and stating them, and achieving buy-in are critical
          to getting someone to adapt their behavior. Mistakes like suggestive
          questions, “you have to fix it” messaging and inflexible plans will

          feedback chat, “a mix of a team member writing a self-assessment and a

          areas or skills you’d like to develop? What’s one way your team lead

          every time I’ve done one, the manager and I wind up talking about
          important topics, pushing ourselves to promote and reward people who
          deserve it, and taking action where needed. It also helps me know our
          whole team better, and get clear signals from managers that make
          interactions with each person more meaningful. I highly recommend the
          practice.” Includes a template to get you started.

          how the employee can work anywhere, what they’re great at, improvement

          else the company can offer to help them grow.

          - by Michael Lynch. Takeaway: A former Google engineer describes how
          Google’s promotions committee setup meant that the legacy pipeline
          project he worked on didn’t produce the metrics required to impress
          committee members. “Google kept telling me that it couldn’t judge my
          work until it saw me complete a project. Meanwhile, I couldn’t
          complete any projects because Google kept interrupting them midway
          through and assigning me new ones. My career was being dictated by a
          shifting, anonymous committee who thought about me for an hour of
          their lives. Management decisions that I had no input into were
          erasing months of my career progress.”

        was that people would be more candid if they 1) submitted feedback
        anonymously 2) to someone else. Because we tend to amplify negative
        feedback, there was a benefit to having someone else go through it, find
        trends, and repackage it for the recipient.”
