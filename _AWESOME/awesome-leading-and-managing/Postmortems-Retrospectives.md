## Postmortems and Retrospectives

### Postmortems

- [Etsy’s Guide to Postmortems](https://extfiles.etsy.com/DebriefingFacilitationGuide.pdf) - by John Allspaw, Morgan Evans and Daniel Schauenberg. A lengthy document that provides a guide on the art of asking questions. [On Failure and Resilience](https://beero.ps/2017/06/17/on-failure-and-resilience/) provides a briefer summary, describing an Etsy incident and how the team managed it.

- [Improving Postmortem Practices with Veteran Google SRE, Steve McGhee](https://www.blameless.com/improve-postmortem-with-sre-steve-mcghee/) - by Blameless.

- [The Infinite Hows (or, the Dangers of The Five Whys)](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2014/11/14/the-infinite-hows-or-the-dangers-of-the-five-whys/) - by John Allspaw. Takeaway: A slight tweak to the “5 whys." Allspaw points out that “why” leads to blaming a person, while “how” leads to blaming the system.

- [Making SWOT Analysis Actionable](http://articles.bplans.com/swot-analysis-challenge-day-5-turning-swot-analysis-actionable-strategies/) - by Lisa Furgison. Takeaway: Make connections between each quadrant of your analysis, combining information from two quadrants to create actionable strategies:
  - Strengths–Opportunities. Use internal strengths to take advantage of opportunities
  - Strengths-Threats. Use your strengths to minimize threats
  - Weaknesses-Opportunities. Improve weaknesses by taking advantage of opportunities
  - Weaknesses-Threats. Work to eliminate weaknesses to avoid threats

- [The Root Cause Fallacy](https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/07/21/root-cause-fallacy/) - by Baron Schwartz. Takeaway: Asking why repeatedly will always get you to the CEO, eventually; stop looking for a single root cause — instead, identify system of conditions/dysfunctions that jointly caused the problem; change the culture and own failures as opportunities.

- [Social Issues in Postmortems](https://medium.com/@allspaw/social-issues-in-postmortems-d48dde624d18) - by John Allspaw. Takeaway: "Although apparently technically focused, postmortems are inherently social events. Especially for events with significant consequences, there are incentives to direct attention towards some issues and away from others. When large losses incur attention of senior management the tenor and content of the postmortem may shift away from freewheeling discourse to a more closed ended, narrowly technical discussion. Postmortems may become “stage plays” intended to assert organizational control, ratify management decisions, or localize and truncate the inquiry into circumstances and contributors."

- [Why Airbnb Encourages Employees to Predict Its Own Downfall](http://www.inc.com/adam-vaccaro/airbnb-demise.html) - by Adam Vaccaro. Takeaway: Imagine the disruption that causes your company’s demise. Have pre-mortems: “Meet before a project and imagine they're a few months or a year in the future and that the project has failed.” Or the opposite: “the team imagines absolute success--and talks through the crucial hypothetical points in the process where the right decisions were made.”

"[E]mbracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your project. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward.

- [How to Run HUGE Retrospectives Across Dozens of Teams in Multiple Time Zones](http://www.innovationgames.com/2014/06/how-to-run-huge-retrospectives/) - by Luke Hohmann. Takeaway: "[T]raditional approaches to retrospectives – assembling a group people in a room with one or more facilitators – are too costly, don’t scale, take far too long and fail to produce high-impact results. As a consequence, large organizations either skip retrospectives entirely or they relegate retrospectives to individual teams, which tragically limit their effectiveness in identifying and implementing enterprise changes that can profoundly improve performance. Over time, because individual teams are not obtaining material benefits from retrospectives, they stop doing them at all." Using online games can be a less expensive option.

- [How We Do Large Scale Retrospectives](https://labs.spotify.com/2015/11/05/large-scale-retros/) - by Henrik Kniberg.
