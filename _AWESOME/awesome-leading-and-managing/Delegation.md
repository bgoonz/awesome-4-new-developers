Takeaway: “If there isn’t something going off the rails on your team, then I know you’re micro-managing them. You’re good at what you do, and if you stay in the weeds on everything, you’ll keep things going perfectly, for a while. But eventually two things will happen. One, you’ll burn out. And two, you’ll eventually start to seriously piss off your team. So I better see some things going sideways, on a fairly regular basis.”
