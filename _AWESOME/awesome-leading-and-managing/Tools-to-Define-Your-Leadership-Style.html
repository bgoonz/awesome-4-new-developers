            >Why and How to Share Your Manager README (Plus Here’s Mine)</a
          >
          - by Katie Womersley. Takeaway: “Defining what you value as a leader
          and what the shared expectations between you and your direct reports
          are achieves two things: 1) folks know who you are and what to expect
          from you, and 2) they’re much more able to give you feedback and hold
          you accountable. If they know what you believe and expect as manager,
          folks will feel more confident that any behaviour of yours that’s not
          aligned is likely unintended and something you’d be eager to hear
          about and fix.”
