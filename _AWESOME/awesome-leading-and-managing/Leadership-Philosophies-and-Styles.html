          >
          - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: “Studies have found that the biggest reason
          for why people don’t speak up at work is because they believe it is
          futile. Employees don’t think anything will happen with their feedback
          … so they don’t give it … If you want honest feedback, you must act on
          the feedback you’ve gotten in some way. Prove to employees it’s worth
          their effort to be honest with you.”

          - by Lisa Rosh and Lynn Offerman. Takeaway: “Sharing details about
          your life can be a valuable way to build relationships in the
          workplace. But self-disclosures can also lead to oversharing, which
          can do more harm than good in the office.”

          >
          - by Michael Useem and Harbir Singh. Takeaway: “[W]hen time is limited
          and stakes are high, the most effective leaders rely on their ranks to
          do what they do best. These leaders empower people to use their
          expertise to solve problems and achieve goals. They also enable
          managers at every level of the organization to think like CEOs, making
          decisions with a large degree of autonomy. There’s a clear system in
          place for monitoring progress, but it doesn’t impede people from
          getting the work done. This is strategic leadership at its best, and
          in a moment of crisis it becomes all the more critical.”

          >
          - by Roger L. Martin. Takeaway: “1. Make only the set of choices you
          are more capable of making than anyone else. 2. Explain the choice
          that has been made and the reasoning behind it. 3. Explicitly identify
          the next downstream choice. 4. Assist in making the downstream choice,
          as needed. 5. Commit to revisit and modify the choice based on
          downstream feedback.”

          celebrating their contributions and strove to interact with people
          face-to-face.

          >
          - by John C. Maxwell. Takeaway: “…leaders are not born, they’re made”;
          “Good leaders don’t just resolve the issue to get it off their plates
          quickly for the sake of their own comfort. They help create solutions
          that take their people and their organization forward and put them in
          a better position than they were in before they experienced the
          problem.”

          >
          - by Farnam Street. Takeaway: a series of bullet points identifying
          the differences. Examples: “Amateurs give up at the first sign of
          trouble and assume they’re failures. Professionals see failure as part
          of the path to growth and mastery; Amateurs don’t have any idea what
          improves the odds of achieving good outcomes. Professionals do.”

          >
          - by Matthew Mamet. Takeaway: “Fostering a culture of accountability
          within the team (people do what they say they will do) is key for
          effective product management over the long haul. Creating and
          fostering the concept of Directly Responsible Individuals (DRI) within
          product teams is an effective method of increase PM leverage.”

            Leadership</a

          be steady and dependable; remember that modesty is the best policy,
          balance analysis with action, be vigilant — vulnerability increases
          over time.

          - by Brendan Ward. Takeaway: effective leaders set, communicate, and
          reinforce tangible goals toward broader impact. They set priorities
          and act strategically, share the opportunity to lead, and listen more
          than they talk. They are highly introspective, actively seek feedback,
          grow from their mistakes, and are constantly learning across a broad
          range of topics.

          >
          - by Benjamin Encz. Takeaway: Encz has identified three types of
          leader — “tech lead engineering manager (typically technology stack
          focused team, still lots of coding, leadership via technical merits,
          good for recruiting); product team engineering manager (team spans
          multiple technology stacks, can touch on product management and
          project management, needs to think more about cross-functional
          interactions); people engineering manager (very focused on people
          aspects, has strong individual contributors who drive a lot of
          decision making, hiring, etc., can support larger team).”

          >
          - by Esko Kilpi. Takeaway: “The future is accordingly described as
          goals and performance targets. Following this logic, the role of
          management is to control the movement into a chosen future. But what
          management really is, is about reduction of anxiety. Anxiety levels in
          the experiences of individuals most often depend on the perceived
          level of control people have over themselves and their environment.
          This drives our need to believe that someone is, or should be, in
          control.”

          - by Lauren A. Keating, Peter A. Heslin and Susan J. Ashford.
          Takeaway: “[R]esearch on leadership development shows that leaders who
          are in learning mode develop stronger leadership skills than their
          peers.” Being experienced helps, but isn’t enough.

          >
          - by Sam McAfee. Takeaway: “After 20 years in this field, I’d say
          without hesitation that usually about 80% of the problem is with the
          leadership itself. Now I have to look a senior leader square in the
          eye and tell them that, in fact, they are actually the problem. That
          their people learned all of their behaviors from the modeling of the
          leader. That they set the tone in terms of what is acceptable to talk
          about openly, and what is strictly off limits. And the vast majority
          of these signals from leadership are extremely subtle, not necessarily
          intended to be signals at all.”

          manager is not committed to communicating clearly/effectively,
          developing people and removing obstacles so they can get things done.

          >
          - by Brian Anderson and Camille Fournier. Takeaway: “Good technical
          leaders are capable of understanding systems through many different
          lenses. They understand that their companies are shaped by people and
          technologies and processes, and they’re capable of investigating each
          of these areas to understand how it contributes to the current success
          or challenges of the team. Good technical leaders have a strong sense
          of technical empathy, which helps them appreciate the challenges their
          engineers are facing, even if those engineers are working on problems
          that the leader has never personally written code to solve. Finally,
          good technical leaders have good technical judgment.”

          - by Srikar Doddi. Takeaway: Offers insights into how to change your
          style based on the needs of the team. Takeaways: Always be explicit
          with how you expect each individual in the team to behave and the
          results you’d like them to achieve, and hold everyone accountable.
          That starts with you, and the example you set to everyone else. Having
          a well-articulated vision and expectation will enable flexibility of
          style and methods to reach a highly performant execution. See also,

          Case reveals that dominance and prestige are two frequent motivators
          to becoming a leader, and gender is not a relevant factor in which
          motivator a person leans toward. Prestige-motivated leadership is
          distinctly human.

          management and leadership. Management is decision making and the
          handling of resources. Leadership goes beyond management to craft and
          maintain the interpersonal glue that makes your organization a team.”

          “Everything’s been done before. The scenes change but the behaviors

          you have to; share what makes you tick, then have your team do the
          same; forget the competition, and let things happen instead of always
          making them happen.

          expressing vulnerability. In his sign-off, he wrote to his team: “I
          have to tell you I am scared.” Vulnerability is an underrated

          ground in order to run a successful company, and thinking about your
          business as a machine that you design and optimize, instead of
          becoming a worn out cog within.”

          to learn to consider how your work affects others, and how to work
          with people to get things done. The higher up you go in any
          organization, the harder it is to get things done on your own. So
          invest in building relationships every step of the way, and you’ll
          have more people who want to see you succeed when your time comes.”

        - A political article, but it provides one the most complete leadership
        frameworks we’ve seen. Values are the linchpin in the model, but
        important things precede and flow from values:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Experience: the total knowledge extracted from yr life
            i.e. understanding, wisdom, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Judgement: ability to make considered decisions or come to sensible
            conclusions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Values: your principles or standards of behavior. What you believe
            is important in life.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vision: ability to articulate an ambitious and seemingly
            unattainable goal.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strategy: ability to explain the steps necessary to achieve that
            vision.
          </li>
          <li>

          (physical, emotional and mental); say “not now, not ever” using “no”
          templates; avoid decision debt — create process and structure that
          doesn’t need you; challenge the “when” to make speed a habit; beat
          burnout with prioritization and communication techniques; and balance
          internal and external movitations to see yourself and decisions more
          clearly.

          Net Promoter Scores as manager thermometers; Enterprise Value &gt;
          Team Value &gt; Self Value; be the Chief Pothole Prevention Officer
          and the Chief Explanation Officer; everything needs to work right
          almost all the time; you have to make decisions; make them the right
          decisions instead of the most popular ones; do things right instead of
          fast; balance the pressure for short-term results while making
          long-term investments; document strategy.

          - by Julie Zhuo. Takeaway: You must like dealing with people to be
          great at management; having all the answers is not the goal—motivating
          the team to find the answers is; evaluate the strength of a manager by
          looking at the strength of their team; the most significant advantage
          a senior manager has over a junior manager is an expanded perspective;
          aligning on why is more important than aligning on how; sometimes a
          great person will not work out on a great team, and that is okay; you
          never regret moving a struggling person too soon—you only regret doing
          it too late; your team should respect you, but you don’t need them to
          agree with everything you say or do.

          - by Johnathan Nightingale. Takeaway: Denying power inequities serves
          no one, and skims over the real existence of privilege that comes with
          power. “Own the authority of your role. If that authority is
          uncomfortable and you’re worried about wielding it poorly, then get
          educated. You can be a better boss than the ones you’ve had. Figure
          out when your duty of service is to the individuals on your team, and
          when it’s to the organization at large. Figure out how you want to act
          in the rare but real cases where those are in conflict.”

          “S’Up” informal gathering of three randomly selected colleagues, which
          reinforces tribal leadership. “Stages of Tribal Leadership are often
          categorized by evaluating the number of connections and communication
          channels between team members, and triads are the most stable and
          valuable foundations, a building block of a Stage Four culture. S’Up
          is a tool we built that creates triads. The result can often feel
          inspiring and lead to durable communication channels at scale.”

          thereof, shame (the fear of disconnection and being unworthy of
          connection). Connection and being aware of its need results in more
          effective leadership because one can then reach/inspire/enliven
          people.

          in the room, or ego.

          >
          - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: Five things leaders can do to stop
          worrying, an activity that doesn’t necessarily improve or resolve
          things. “Instead of idling in indecision and mulling over every
          possible path and course of action, the question ‘What’s the most I
          can do with what I have right now?’ forces your hand. You must deal
          with the cards in front of you. And once you do, you’ll clear a path
          to move forward within the constraints you have. Now you can focus on
          what you can control.”
