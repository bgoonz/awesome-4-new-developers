            >Can You “Fix” Colleagues Who Aren’t Self-Aware?</a
          >
          - by Daniel Goleman, the author of <em>Emotional Intelligence</em>.
          Takeaway: “Working with someone who has low Emotional Self-Awareness
          isn’t just an annoyance for co-workers, it impacts everyone’s ability
          to perform well in their work. Research by Korn Ferry Hay Group and
          others show that a leader’s high Emotional Self-Awareness contributes
          to overall performance.”

            >Can Your Employees Really Speak Freely?</a
          >
          - by James R. Detert and Ethan R. Burris. Takeaway: Being open and
          receptive of feedback leads to higher retention and better
          performance. Anonymous feedback is counter-productive because it sends
          the message that one must remain anonymous in the environment; it does
          not necessarily lead to more authentic outcomes. And “the biggest
          reason for withholding ideas and concerns wasn’t fear but, rather, the
          belief that managers wouldn’t do anything about them anyway.”

          >
          - by Chris Murman at ThoughtWorks. Takeaway: what you can do when you
          rely upon feedback and reviews from multiple people. Ask for feedback
          frequently and proactively, in small measures. “Giving your co-workers
          some specific questions or topics you want to discuss in advance
          focuses the conversation. It also steers the conversation away from
          personal feelings. The giver can focus on helping me.”

          >
          - by Dave Peth. Takeaway: “[L]ike a good story, good feedback can take
          us out of ourselves, allowing us to see the work more clearly. It can
          remove the artificial barrier between feedback giver and receiver,
          refocusing both on shared goals. Change your habits around feedback,
          and you can change the story of your project.”

          >
          - by Jessica Collins. Takeaway: Leaders are people too, and giving
          them feedback keeps them in touch with the organization, and motivates
          them to continue doing the “right” things.

          >
          - by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: When giving constructive feedback,
          pay attention to how ICs get stuck and address those habits—endless
          research, helping others instead of doing their own work, refactoring,
          and other ways.

          >
          - by Jocelyn K. Glei. Takeaway: When circumstances require you to give
          negative feedback via email, start with appreciation; provide
          specific, actionable direction; avoid using the imperative; emphasize
          progress; and use the word “yet.”

          Request) method. <em>Observation</em> of a fact: A fact is rarely
          controversial, and a great way to start a conversation.
          <em>Feeling</em>: express your feelings and your story. Clarify that
          it’s your story. <em>Need</em>: state what you value, or the kind of
          impact you’d like to see. <em>Request</em>: explain what concrete
          action the other person would need to take.

          >
          - by Tom Bartel. Provides a simple, four-step structure for giving
          feedback: 1) Describe a event (with facts) and the consequences, while
          criticizing only the behavior; 3) collect suggestions from the
          feedback receiver; by suggesting a solution themselves, they have an
          active part and become accountable; 4) make an agreement how to move
          on and follow up.

            >The Problem with “Constructive Feedback”</a
          >
          - by Kim Scott. Takeaway: “It’s hard to sound or be humble when
          saying, ‘I’ve got some constructive feedback for you.’ This sounds
          like you’re saying that you know a truth that the other person doesn’t
          know, and you’re going to tell them this truth. It’s sort of like
          saying, ‘You have a problem, I’m going to tell you what it is, and
          you’re going to fix it.’” Remember to offer praise and to remain
          humble.

          - by Sabina Nawaz. Takeaway: “Not every problem has an easy solution.
          Tackling the complexity of most significant business issues can take a
          pool of talented people with diverse points of view. What’s more,
          according to Wharton professor Adam Grant, solution-only thinking
          creates ‘a culture of advocacy instead of one of inquiry,’ where each
          person comes into the situation locked into their way of solving the
          problem and lobbies hard for that particular solution rather than
          considering multiple perspectives.”

          the trend chaser, and the smartest person in the room. See also

            >The Secrets to Building a Constructive Feedback Culture</a
          >
          - by Mark Lukens. Takeaway: “To be constructive, feedback needs to be
          specific, showing people where to focus their efforts in improving. It
          needs to focus on the product, not the person, making clear that the
          employee who did the work is not under attack. People who feel
          attacked, or who are not given a clear way forward, will become
          defensive and less open to feedback.” Be open and considerate, and
          avoid casual feedback because it suggests you don’t care.

          >
          - by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: By answering your own questions, “I
          am talking to hear myself speak, rather than genuinely asking for more
          information that would help me understand the plan and allow me to
          give better feedback. By stating my preference up-front I cut off
          discussion. What’s worse, I make the receiver unlikely to honestly
          answer my question; unless, that is, they feel up to the task of
          debating me…If you are (or were) a highly opinionated engineer,
          practicing making space for information rather than quickly jumping in
          and sharing your conclusions is a must for leadership growth.”

          >
          - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: Layering the feedback “good-bad-good” is
          for the feedback giver’s benefit only. To get better results the
          feedback giver should come from a place of care, observation,
          fallibility, and curiosity.

          Research Consortium Staff. Takeaway: This is the summary of a book
          around Difficult Conversations in general, but extremely useful for
          all managers while giving feedback - positive or otherwise. “Good
          communication is important both in formal negotiations and in daily
          life. This book explores what makes some conversations difficult, why
          people avoid having difficult conversations, and why people often
          manage difficult conversations poorly. The authors offer techniques
          for having more effective, fruitful discussions.”

          it as a kindness; consider giving it to be a skill; encourage
          employees to give it without permission; give role feedback; aim to
          grow from feedback. “Feedback is how we scale as a company; it’s how
          we make sure we keep helping each other.”

            >The Value of Failure and Feedback: a Guide</a
          >
          - by Jono Bacon. Takeaway: Drawing from personal experiences, Bacon
          identifies examples of transformative feedback—feedback that reveals
          new levels or types of self-awareness that one can leverage to improve
          performance. "Soliciting constructive feedback has two key parts: When
          you get feedback, you need to always be receptive and never defensive
          or frustrated. To receive great feedback, you have to build a
          permissive relationship with others that means they can share it
          without worrying about you being…well…defensive or frustrated.

          - by Alicia Liu. Takeaway: “Before giving any feedback, it’s important
          to understand that every relationship is two-sided. If you’re having
          interpersonal issues while working with someone, it’s just as much on
          you as it is on them to change, in order to get to a better working
          relationship.”
