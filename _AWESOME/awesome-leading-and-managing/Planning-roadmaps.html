          - by Gergely Orosz. Takeaway: How to set up an architecture jam.
          “Architecture done for the sake of architecture is a poor investment.
          You’ll want to solve an actual problem, ship this as a solution and
          confirm that it works and improves things.”

          Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures. “Always start with a
          beginner’s mind, which is a concept that comes from Zen Buddhism — a
          beginner’s mind allows you to constantly see the world with fresh
          eyes. This mindset will help you declutter your mind, dispose of
          outdated assumptions, eliminate distractions, and allow yourself to
          focus on the what, why, and how of whatever you set out to do.”

          by Amplitude. Takeaway: a downloadable book on the North Star
          Framework, with guidance for running a North Star workshop and
          settling on a North Star metric. The North Star is “a model for
          managing products by identifying a single, crucial metric (the North
          Star Metric) that, according to Sean Ellis, ‘best captures the core
          value that your product delivers to [its] customers.’”

          >
          - by Axel Bichara. Takeaway: “There is no mystery to writing an
          operating plan. An operating plan is a list of everything you intend
          to do as a business over the next 6–12 months. Think of it as a
          month-by-month to-do list for all aspects of your company…A great
          operating plan helps you identify earlier when your burn rate is
          higher than you hoped. This buys you enough time to to
          course-correct.”

            >Product Requirements Template</a

          - by Unusual Ventures. Takeaway: A template that drives a thoughtful
          analysis of product requirements via guiding questions structured to
          tell a coherent story. Includes a “Press Release” field that draws
          from Amazon’s methods.

          tools (like

            Eventbrite</a
          >
          - by Lenny Rachitsky and Nels Gilbreth. Takeaway: “[T]he root cause of
          nearly all bad planning processes is very simple: a basic lack of
          understanding of roles — who is responsible for what, when. For
          example, who should have a say in the plan, and when? What exactly
          does each stakeholder need to deliver, and to whom? Who sets the
          timelines? Who holds everyone accountable? And who makes the final
          call? These questions are too often left unanswered, which leads to
          chaos and disappointment during the planning process.” Includes
          discussion of the W Framework, created by the authors to drive
          planning at all levels of an organization, and a
          <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JI73WrGplrhNE46aLyRD_B74gEynI77EPgXn1ic6WeQ/edit#"
            >template</a
          >. The Framework covers these four pillars: “1. Context: Leadership
          shares a high-level strategy with Teams; 2. Plans: Teams respond with
          proposed plans; 3. Integration: Leadership integrates into a single
          plan, and shares with Teams; 4. Buy-in: Teams make final tweaks,
          confirm buy-in, and get rolling.”

          new system or functionality, I’ll typically make a spike or two (or
          three or four) to demonstrate the concept. By ‘spike’ I mean writing
          just enough code to check how something could work. The purpose of
          this is to gain insight, and could have different motivations.”

          covers three models of opportunity cost (including the Eisenhower
          Matrix), three models of leverage (an example is the 80/20 rule), and
          three models of what not to do when prioritizing.

          - by Melissa Perri. Takeaway: “In the absence of a product strategy,
          the most critical job function of a Product Leader is to set one. If
          you want your teams to prioritize, you need to provide the framework.
          And not just some arbitrary framework …Your people need a real
          strategy, based on data, and aligned to a company’s goals.”

          flexibility for both discovery and delivery. To do this, we focus on
          Product Roadmaps that are made up of outcomes, a theme, and

          roadmap is that it’s visual, accessible and clear enough for anyone to
          scan for answers to the following questions: What are we doing? Why
          are we doing it? How does this tie back to our OKRs? This is the
          fundamental idea behind a theme-based product roadmap – and its
          benefits are enormous and immediate.”

      - by Tami Reiss. Takeaway: The first step in this series about building a
      roadmap. “A good company vision will: Be connected with the company

      mid-level leaders to know how their team can contribute to achieving the

      >
      - by Denise Tilles. Takeaway: “The first step in establishing product
      operations is getting that manual baseline … Inputs for this baseline will
      come from finance, sales, customer support, data science, engineering, at
      the very least. Once you’ve created that full picture of topline and
      bottom line revenue drivers you’ll be well positioned to inform your 2020
      planning.” -

      - by Tami Reiss. Takeaway: Includes a chart featuring 16 “Product
      Strategies for Growth” for leaders. “You should run through the list as
      you are generating options to make sure you’ve exhausted all paths
      available to you. If you know you want to add new customers, grow lifetime
      value, or increase profitability, look at those columns to find strategies
      which produce that result.” -

      >
      - by Tami Reiss. Takeaway: “without considering cost of delay, validating
      with data, and thinking about the impact on key accounts, big pieces of
      the prioritization puzzle are missing…Data is more informative and
      concrete than consensus and gut feel. You want to lead a team of product
      managers who rely on cold hard facts to support their choices, not
      subjective rankings filled with bias.” -

      - by Denise Tilles. Takeaway: “There are a variety of ways your roadmap
      can express your strategic intentions. What’s important is to show how
      you’re driving towards outcomes. And from those strategic intentions,
      you’ll have initiatives that evolve from a problem into a solution.”
