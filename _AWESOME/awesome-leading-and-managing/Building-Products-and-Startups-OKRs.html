    <p>
      As a leader of a product development team you might have a PM that you’re
      working with, but some of your role will involve deciding how/when product
      is built, who builds what, etc. So you’ll need to level up your product
      skills.

          - by FirstRound Capital. Takeaway: Todd Jackson (former product
          manager of Gmail, among other credentials) on how “[b]uilding really
          high-quality products takes an incredible amount of behind-the-scenes
          discipline, especially as your team grows.” He also advises to protect
          quality and the user experience, and to take a site reliability
          engineering approach.

          - by Anthony Eden. Provides a simple project management spreadsheet of
          six questions: 1) What is the problem we are trying to solve?; 2) What
          does success look like, and how does it fit in the big picture?; 3)
          What are the MUST DO and the MUST NOT DO items?; 4) What is the
          deadline?; 5) Who should I talk to for help and get feedback?; 6) Have
          we done this before? Something we already have to get started?

          - by Harry McCracken. Takeaway: Instagram founders made technical
          decisions using a principle which favored practicality over
          perfection. “If it solves a problem and gets us closer to launch,
          let’s do it.”

          - by Product Habits. Takeaway: Offers a step-by-step template for
          creating a 1-3 page technical research outline that will enable
          product leads to communicate plans more effectively with developers,
          who can then better do the research on their side required to build a
          product successfully. “The outline should be a short summary of what
          you’re looking to create, including required features and
          functionality. You should also provide guidance on what matters most
          to you (and customers). What’s the core problem you’re looking to
          solve, and how do you plan to solve it? What are the most important
          parts of what you’re building?”

          - by Jessica Kerr. Takeaway: An exploration of what tools are Low-Risk
          (local developer utilities), Moderate Risk 1 (deployment
          infrastructure), Moderate Risk 2 (programming language), and serious
          risk (database). “When you do accept a technology into your stack,
          make sure it has an owner. Spread knowledge through pairing,
          documentation, and communication. Make responsibility explicit and set
          aside time for maintenance, upgrades, and reassessment. The right
          technology today will be the wrong technology at some point.”

          - by Julie Zhuo. Takeaway: “When you get into a TTBQT (‘The Tradeoff

          Scaling Without A Religious Methodology. My argument isn’t that
          packaged scaling methods are unhelpful per se, rather that they are
          neither necessary nor sufficient for successful transformation. They
          can be anything from a useful starting point to an expensive
          distraction, but one thing they are not is a solution.”

          - by Jim Grey. Takeaway: “People sometimes fetishize startup
          smallness. It feels so good! But clinging to it will limit your growth
          trajectory. Like the overgrown fly, lack of process will crush your
          company. You need to change your ways of working to fit the company’s
          size. But this doesn’t have to be terrible. It totally can be
          terrible, if you do it wrong. Even if you do it right, it will change
          and even get rid of some of your company’s original goodness. But it
          enables new levels of goodness that you can’t imagine yet.”

          the world with your idea, but if you focus the best people in the room
          on only the known unknowns, you’ll have a much better shot at
          winning.”

          - by Rik Higham. Takeaway: “There is a flaw at the heart of the term
          Minimum Viable Product: it’s not a product. It’s a way of testing
          whether you’ve found a problem worth solving. A way to reduce risk and
          quickly test your biggest assumption. Instead of building an MVP
          identify your Riskiest Assumption and Test it. Replacing your MVP with
          a RAT will save you a lot of pain.”

          - by Jeff Zych. Takeaway: a focused overview of the book by UCLA
          Anderson School of Management professor Richard P. Rumelt. “Strategy
          is designing a way to deal with a challenge. A good strategy,
          therefore, must identify the challenge to be overcome, and design a
          way to overcome it. To do that, the kernel of a good strategy contains
          three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.”
          Includes some critical thoughts on OKRs.

          >
          - by Dan Hill. Takeaway: “Most Product Managers (and everyone
          probably) spend too little time thinking about how to solve a problem.
          They jump straight into solving it. Problems come in different shapes,
          and not all need the same process. The process that shipped the last
          product is unlikely to be the one that you need for the
          next…Incremental development and vision are not orthogonal; they both
          require the other. All product must start with a vision — a point of
          view — but then be built critically step by step. It’s ok to learn
          something new as you go.”

          >
          - by Josh Elman at Greylock Partners. Takeaway: “[T]he only thing
          founders need to think about is: Are people using your product? Are
          they using it how you expect (i.e performing the core action)? And,
          are they performing the core action at the frequency you expect?”

            >Product Discovery Anti-Patterns Leading to Failure</a
          >
          - by Stefan Wolpers. Takeaway: “The main contributing variables to
          various product discovery anti-patterns are: * Existing organizational
          dysfunctions, for example, the organization is structured in
          functional silos; * A substantial degree of ego issues among
          individual players—the what-is-in-for-me-syndrome—resulting in
          personal agendas being pursued; * A complex, multi-layered reporting
          structure within organizations that filters as well as delays the flow
          of information, thus impeding communication and decision-making.”

            >Product Manager vs. Product Owner</a
          >
          - by Melissa Perri. Takeaway: “A good Product Manager is taught how to
          prioritize work against clear outcome oriented goals, how to discover
          and validate real customer and business value, and what processes are
          needed to reduce the uncertainty that the product will succeed in
          market. Without this background in Product Management, someone can
          effectively go through the motions of Product Owner role in Scrum, but
          they can never be successful in making sure they are building the
          right thing.”

          >
          - by Brent Tworetzky. Takeaway: “While finding the perfect
          user-product fit is rarely easy, trained product managers can find
          great fits consistently with User Science–the field of deeply
          understanding people interacting with products through rigorous
          toolings and process. User science involves understanding both user
          needs (identifying which problem to solve) and user behaviors
          (understanding how and why users react to products). This distinction
          is important: winning products need both a meaningful problem to solve
          and strong execution.”

          - by Jeremy Baker. Takeaway: The progress our customer wants to make
          is the most important thing. We think about our features and what they
          can do, and present them that way. When we do this, we’re “forcing our
          customer to do the hard work. They have to map features to their
          process and figure out if it helps them make progress … Instead, talk
          about the progress our customer wants to make, and build tools that
          enable that progress.”

          Continuously identify the next most important problem we should be
          solving for our customers. We’ve written about this in the past.
          Understand (roughly) the cost and benefit of solving the problem, and
          our confidence level in both side of the equation. Find the optimal
          set of tradeoffs between product scope and engineering costs in
          solving the problem.”

          - by John Yorke. Takeaway: “Agile Transformation means thinking of
          Products rather than Projects. Agile is a Mindset not a set of rules
          to be followed. It requires a cultural change not a process change.
          Agile changes the way we measure project success and how we measure
          people’s behaviour. Change is Hard. Project Management and People
          Management are those that need to change the most.”

          filled with challenging problems to solve. To the neophyte it seems
          like startup challenges are strictly product or technical in nature
          but to innovate, systematize and scale a billion dollar company it
          involves way more decisions about strategy, economics, resource
          allocations and team composition.”

          >
          - by Veronika Goncalves. Takeaway: “In many cases, when organizations
          apply OKRs, they apply the process the in the same format as
          Management by Objectives: using a Top-Down Approach. But this format
          does not create value for the organization because the top managers do
          not understand what the customer’s real problems are. When defining
          the objectives, they are usually not in alignment with the company’s
          current reality.” Also, OKRs might not be the right framework for
          every company; consider options like agile portfolio management.
