          >
          - by Rands in Repose. Takeaway: In times of decision-making, it’s best
          to go last in expressing your views because by this time, everyone
          else has provided context you’ll need to make the best decision. Also,
          take the temperature of whatever room you’re in so you can communicate
          effectively, and don’t micromanage.

          - by Andrea Tomasini. Takeaway: an interactive game in which a
          “product management board” of stakeholders decides, in a manner
          inspired by Planning Poker, which goals to prioritize based on
          relative value to the business.

          - by John Cutler. Takeaway: “[W]e want rapid throughput of small,
          safe-to-fail decisions, coupled with focus and attention on the
          high-level strategic decisions that will set the course for the org
          for months/years…Consider the irony that many orgs spend $50k to make
          a single decision over work that will take two weeks to actually
          implement and test.”

          — by Ellen Gottesdiener. Takeaway: Offers suggestions to help teams

          whether they’ve come to a consensus or not and includes a “gradient of
          agreement”

          - by Tomasz Tunguz. Takeaway: “I’ll never know as much about a
          company’s operations or strategy or a sector as a founder/management
          team. But, I still want to be helpful. So, the most effective strategy
          I’ve found so far is to probe how the decision was made. Answer a
          question with a trenchant question, which coincidentally, ties back to
          some of the best advice I’ve received from a founder.”

          >
          - by Jan Zborowski. Takeaway: Ensuring a safe decision-making
          environment for all employees is a must in a self-managed company.
          Letting ordinary employees propose an idea and then implement it, to
          jointly shape the company’s future, results in a low rotation
          indicator. A flat and transparent business model translates directly
          into clients’ happiness and a company’s growth.

            >“Do We All Agree” Is a Terrible Question</a
          >
          - by Hunter Walk. Takeaway: We often confuse ‘collaboration’ with
          ‘consensus.’ The former is about engaging a group of people to work
          together and discuss ideas. It aims to make the whole greater than the
          sum of its parts. The best leaders are certainly collaborative."

          >
          - by Villi Illtchev. Takeaway: Be clear what you are NOT going to do;
          don’t waste time debating two-way doors; push decision making down
          into the organization; and depoliticise.

          >
          - by Nicholas C. Zakas. Takeaway: “Each question is designed to reveal
          something about the problem that allows you to go to the next step, or
          if you’re lucky, just avoid the problem altogether.” Zakas provides
          his five questions as well as subtle explanations and context for
          each.

          >— by Leo Polovets. Takeaway: lists common risks and heuristics for
          risk mitigation and decision-making. States that showing is better
          than telling; external validation is better than personal opinion, and
          more data is better. Identifies types of risk, from product quality
          and recruiting to product/market fit.

            >How to Make One of the Most Difficult Decisions as a Manager</a
          >
          — by Netanel Lev. Takeaway: Understand that leaving your job as a
          manager is a process with emotions involved. Find a mentor to guide
          you through the situation, have an exit plan, don’t blame other people
          or be blindly loyal, and trust your instincts.

          >
          - by Hunter Walk. Takeaway: “In any system with relatively low cost of
          failure and repeatable game scenarios, it would seem that getting the
          decision right is actually what matters.”

          <em
            >The Decision Checklist: A Practical Guide to Avoiding Problems</em
          >
          makes the case for keeping a journal of decisions. “A decision journal
          will help you to slow down, reflect on and understand your decisions,
          and provide a path for you to get better. In the end, taking the time
          to think through problems will save you time. Not only will you make
          better initial decisions, but you’ll spend less time cleaning up the
          mess of poor ones.”

            >The 90% Agreement Rule</a
          >
          - by Lawrence Ripsher. Takeaway: Ripsher asserts that “we spend 90% of
          our time, talking about the 10% of things we disagree on.” This takes
          up time and energy. Instead, “[c]reate clarity (and build on) wherever
          there is ‘about 90% agreement’ first— then come back around and
          address the disagreements after.”

          >
          - by Farnham Street. Takeaway: “Second-order thinkers take into
          account a lot of what we put into our decision journals. Things like,
          What is the range of possible outcomes? What’s the probability I’m
          right? What’s the follow-on? How could I be wrong? The real difference
          for me is that first-order thinkers are the people that look for
          things that are simple, easy, and defendable. Second-order thinkers
          push harder and don’t accept the first conclusion.”

          - by McKinsey. Takeaway: An interview with psychologist Daniel
          Kahneman and scientist Gary Klein. “Society’s epitome of credibility
          is John Wayne, who sizes up a situation and says, ‘Here’s what I’m
          going to do’—and you follow him. We both worry about leaders in
          complex situations who don’t have enough experience, who are just
          going with their intuition and not monitoring it, not thinking about
          it.”—Klein.

          authority and accountability going hand in hand.”

          >
          - by Drake Baer. Takeaway: A Duke University research study shows that
          people with high “intellectual humility” are more open to the
          information coming their way, as a form of “information sensitivity.”
          This means they end up making more informed decisions than those who
          need to be right and ignore evidence.

          >
          - by Elizabeth Doty. Takeaway: Two-way conversations (as opposed to
          conversations in which the “sender” of a message focuses on their own
          half, instead of paying equal attention to the recipient’s message and
          response) can make collaboration occur at a level that can be
          game-changing. Decisions become better and more reflective/inclusive
          of different perspectives and information sources.

          -by Teresa Torres. Takeaway: “Prioritizing solutions is a left-over
          side effect of being output focused. When we are judged by what we
          deliver, the key decisions are focused on what to build when. But when
          we are judged by what outcomes we drive, it’s less about what
          solutions we deliver and more about what problems we solve for our
          customers.”
