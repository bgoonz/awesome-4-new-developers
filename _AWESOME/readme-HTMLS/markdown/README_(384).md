# Awesome NoSQL Guides [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Curated list of resources and links about _using_ NoSQL databases and things to look for when deciding to use one.

A basic definition of NoSQL databases can be found on Wikipedia as:

> “A NoSQL (originally referring to ‘non SQL’ or ‘non relational’) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.”

For actual NoSQL databases, you can go [here](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome#databases), [here](https://hostingdata.co.uk/nosql-database/), [here](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking), [here](https://github.com/igorbarinov/awesome-data-engineering#databases), or [here](https://github.com/kahun/awesome-sysadmin#nosql). Also, not to be confused with the relational database management system, [NoSQL](http://www.strozzi.it/cgi-bin/CSA/tw7/I/en_US/nosql/Home%20Page).
