[<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cassandra_logo.svg" width="140" />](http://cassandra.apache.org/)

Cassandra is a free and open-source, distributed, wide column store, NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Cassandra is supported by the Apache Software Foundation and is also known as Apache Cassandra.

This is a curated list of awesome [Cassandra](https://github.com/apache/cassandra) packages and resources. Maintained by Rahul Singh of [Anant](http://anant.us). Feel free contact me if you’d like to collaborate on this and other awesome lists.
