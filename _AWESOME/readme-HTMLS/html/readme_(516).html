    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Testing is an essential phase in any product life cycle; whether if it’s a
      food, cars, or software production line, the outcomes should match what’s
      expected and meet, satisfy the need that we created the product for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a solid base of understanding how the software components work and
      integrate with each other as well as gaining the skills of breaking things
      is an essential skill-set for any QA engineer. Software testing is the art
      of investigating the software and finding any unintended behavior that
      might generate undesired scenarios.
    </p>

      Below you can find the path for QA and software testing learning curve
      which you might need to start the journey.

    <h2 id="test-plan-sample">Test Plan Sample</h2>
    <p>
      One of the most important documents to be generated by the QA team is the
      test plan, as the team will acting blindly without; not knowing the
      criteria, the starting point, or even when to perform different testing
      types can risk the whole delivery and causes bad code delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Test plan sections and content can vary based on project and delivery
      nature, therefore, the attached test plan PDF is considered as a generic
      one that serves all software testing delivery purposes.

    <ul>
      <li><p>Don’t trust a test code that you didn’t see it failing.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Understand software testing and do not jump into automation;
          personally, I classify automation as an efficient way to work a
          redundant task. make sure to properly design your test criteria and
          later on, you can automate to achieve the previous.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Automation is not more than documenting manually written tests and
          engineering it in a way the code will be readable, understandable, and
          reusable.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make sure that your testing code is actually testing something.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p>Your testing code shall not require testing.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          200~OK is not always okay; Do not rely only on server status while
          testing, getting 200 status for an unauthorized API call is risking
          your software security.
