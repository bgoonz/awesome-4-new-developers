<p>Go is rapidly becoming the preferred language for building web services. While there are plenty of tutorials available that teach Go’s syntax to developers with experience in other programming languages, tutorials aren’t enough. They don’t teach Go’s idioms, so developers end up recreating patterns that don’t make sense in a Go context. This practical guide provides the essential background you need to write clear and idiomatic Go.</p>
<p>No matter your level of experience, you’ll learn how to think like a Go developer. Author Jon Bodner introduces the design patterns experienced Go developers have adopted and explores the rationale for using them. You’ll also get a preview of Go’s upcoming generics support and how it fits into the language.</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to write idiomatic code in Go and design a Go project</li>
<li>Understand the reasons for the design decisions in Go</li>
<li>Set up a Go development environment for a solo developer or team</li>
<li>Learn how and when to use reflection, unsafe, and cgo</li>
<li>Discover how Go’s features allow the language to run efficiently</li>
<li>Know which Go features you should use sparingly or not at all</li>
</ul>

<p>While often considered a fast and compact programming language, Go usually creates large executables that are difficult to run on low-memory or low-powered devices such as microcontrollers or IoT. TinyGo is a new compiler that allows developers to compile their programs for such low-powered devices. As TinyGo supports all the standard features of the Go programming language, you won’t have to tweak the code to fit on the microcontroller.</p>
<p>This book is a hands-on guide packed full of interesting DIY projects that will show you how to build embedded applications. You will learn how to program sensors and work with microcontrollers such as Arduino UNO and Arduino Nano IoT 33. The chapters that follow will show you how to develop multiple real-world embedded projects using a variety of popular devices such as LEDs, 7-segment displays, and timers. Next, you will progress to build interactive prototypes such as a traffic lights system, touchless hand wash timer, and more. As you advance, you’ll create an IoT prototype of a weather alert system and display those alerts on the TinyGo WASM dashboard. Finally, you will build a home automation project that displays stats on the TinyGo WASM dashboard.</p>
<p>By the end of this microcontroller book, you will be equipped with the skills you need to build real-world embedded projects using the power of TinyGo.</p>

<p>Take your Go skills to the next level by learning how to design, develop, and deploy a distributed service. Start from the bare essentials of storage handling, work your way through networking a client and server, turn that single-node application into a distributed system with service discovery and consensus, and then deploy your service to the cloud. All this will make coding in your day job or side projects easier, faster, and more fun.</p>

<p>The Go ecosystem is helping developers to build distributed and scalable systems efficiently. If you plan to jump into this fascinating world, you must know how Go can help you to build REST APIs, use SQL/NoSQL databases, data streaming platforms, gRPC, design your own CLIs, or how to log your programs efficiently just to mention a few. <em>Build Systems with GO: Everything a Gopher Must Know</em> is split into two blocks: the first explores the Go language and its standard library, the second one provides the reader with examples and explanations of the most powerful libraries to be used in any Go development. With more than 200 detailed and straight-forward examples <a href="https://github.com/juanmanuel-tirado/savetheworldwithgo">available at GitHub</a>, this book helps early adopters and experienced developers to have a real view of what a system built with Go looks like.</p>
