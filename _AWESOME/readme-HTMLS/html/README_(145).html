          <strong>Bmon</strong>: (Bandwidth Monitor) is a tool similar to nload
          that shows the traffic load over all the network interfaces on the
          system. The output also consists of a graph and a section with packet
          level details.

          <strong>Collectl</strong>: reports system statistics in a style that
          is similar to dstat, and like dstat it gathers statistics about
          various different system resources like cpu, memory, network etc. Over
          here is a simple example of how to use it to report network
          usage/bandwidth.

          style mode or log the data to a csv or similar file. This example
          shows how to use dstat to report network bandwidth

          <strong>Iftop</strong>: measures the data flowing through individual
          socket connections, and it works in a manner that is different from
          Nload. Iftop uses the pcap library to capture the packets moving in
          and out of the network adapter, and then sums up the size and count to
          find the total bandwidth under use. Although iftop reports the
          bandwidth used by individual connections, it cannot report the process
          name/id involved in the particular socket connection. But being based
          on the pcap library, iftop is able to filter the traffic and report
          bandwidth usage over selected host connections as specified by the
          filter.

          different styles of graphs each of which can be activated using the c,

          library to capture packets and calculate various statistics like the

          filters that can be used to monitor specific connections.

          written by Shawn Ostermann at Ohio University, for analysis of TCP
          dump files. It can take as input the files produced by several popular
          packet- capture programs, including tcpdump, snoop, etherpeek, HP Net
          Metrix, and WinDump. tcptrace can produce several different types of
          output containing information on each connection seen, such as elapsed
          time, bytes and segments sent and received, retransmissions, round
          trip times, window advertisements, throughput, and more. It can also
          produce a number of graphs for further analysis.

          TraceWrangler is a network capture file toolkit running on Windows (or
          on Linux, using WINE) that supports PCAP as well as the new PCAPng
          file format, which is now the standard file format used by Wireshark.
          The most prominent use case for TraceWrangler is the easy sanitization
          and anonymization of PCAP and PCAPng files (sometimes called “trace
          files”, “capture files” or “packet captures”), removing or replacing
          sensitive data while being easy to use.
