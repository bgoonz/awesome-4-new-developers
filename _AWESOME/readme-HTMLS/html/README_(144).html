      This is list of discounts on software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other
      offerings for developers who happen to be students. This list is greatly
      inspired by the
      <a href="https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev">free-for-dev list</a>.

      You can help by sending Pull Requests to add more services. Please read
      the <a href="contributing.md">contribution guidelines</a> first. Once I
      have a good set of links in this README file, I’ll look into a better
      layout for the information and links (help with that is appreciated too).
