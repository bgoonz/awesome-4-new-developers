      Below is a curated list of awesome digital tools for activism. These are
      tools for individuals, ad-hoc groups or formal organizations that are
      campaigning, organizing or communicating for social change. Some of these
      tools are open source projects that requires some technical knowledge to
      set up and host yourself. Some are software-as-a-service tools that you
      use by going to a webpage in your browser. Feel free to share suggestions.
