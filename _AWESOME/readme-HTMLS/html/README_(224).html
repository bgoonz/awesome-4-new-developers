          water nourishes tomatoes, and the tomato bed in turn cleans the water
          which goes back to the fish basins. Their fish is grown without

          Produces a commercial scale hydroponic growing system, which is
          cheaper and easier to install and maintain than traditional hydroponic
          systems. The goal is to bring the benefits of hydroponics (less water

          electricity. It doesn’t require arable land or irrigation and isn’t
          limited by climate conditions. The original concept of Solein was born
          from a NASA space programme, and was further developed in the research
          projects of the Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd and the
          Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT).

          Created an ingredient named Heura which represents a new generation of
          plant-based proteins using innovative production techniques to get
          textures never seen on the vegetal realm. Heura needs 94% less water

          Gives the possibility for restaurants, stores, bakeries and cafés to
          sell unsold food at the end of the day. Since it is impossible to know
          in advance what will be the unsolds of the day, the users get a
          “surprise basket” of about 500g of food. Pretty much like Karma, but
