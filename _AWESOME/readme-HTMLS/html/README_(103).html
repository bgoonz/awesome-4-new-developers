          Given the still small number of women speaking at events (especially
          technology) here in Brazil, a spreadsheet was created to give these
          women visibility and to encourage others to start. Mulheres
          Palestrantes is a project that keeps a list of women who talk about
          themes related to programming, design, entrepreneurship and technology
          in general, this project was born from trying to organize the data of
          the worksheet in a more visual, facilitating access, reducing
          duplication and facilitating research.
