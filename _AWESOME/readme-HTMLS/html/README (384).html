    <p>A basic definition of NoSQL databases can be found on Wikipedia as:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “A NoSQL (originally referring to ‘non SQL’ or ‘non relational’)
        database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is
        modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational
        databases.”
      </p>
