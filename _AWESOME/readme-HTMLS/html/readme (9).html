        Biotechnological beings have rendered people all but extinct. Molecular

        male and female human, a male and female Oankali, and a sexless Ooloi.
        The Oankali and Ooloi are part of an alien race that rescued humanity
        from a devastating nuclear war, but the price they exact is a high one
        the aliens are compelled to genetically merge their species with other
        races, drastically altering both in the process.

        On a rehabilitated Earth, this ‚Äúnew‚Äù race is emerging through
        human/Oankali/Ooloi mating, but there are also ‚Äúpure‚Äù humans who choose
        to resist the aliens and the salvation they offer. These resisters are
        sterilized by the Ooloi so that they cannot reproduce the genetic defect
        that drives humanity to destroy itself, but otherwise they are left
        alone (unless they become violent).

        When the resisters kidnap young Akin, the Oankali choose to leave the

      This book is interesting for its view of what a golden age of mankind
      would look like, and what would the shortcomings of that be. It also has a
      very interesting take on mass psychology - I don‚Äôt want to give away too
      much, but the Overlords are a nifty bunch. This is a good early Clarke,
      and has two of his favorite themes; the first that remote work will be
      possible with technology, and the second that any sufficiently advanced
      technology is indistinguishable from magic. -

      This is a long book, but absolutely fantastic. It redefined for me the
      scale at which science fiction was possible, especially given the human
      elements are very fleshed out (as opposed to other massive space epics,
      like Olaf Stapledon‚Äôs ‚ÄòLast and First Men‚Äô). A brilliant look at the
      future, going off of only two small changes - what if we had drugs to
      defeat death, and cities could fly. -

        Originally published in four volumes nearly fifty years ago,
        <em>Cities in Flight</em> brings together the famed ‚ÄúOkie novels‚Äù of
        science fiction master James Blish. Named after the migrant workers of
        America‚Äôs Dust Bowl, these novels convey Blish‚Äôs ‚Äúhistory of the
        future,‚Äù a brilliant and bleak look at a world where cities roam the
        Galaxy looking for work and a sustainable way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first novel, <em>They Shall Have Stars</em>, man has thoroughly
        explored the Solar System, yet the dream of going even further seems to
        have died in all but one man. His battle to realize his dream results in
        two momentous discoveries anti-gravity and the secret of immortality. In
        <em>A Life for the Stars</em>, it is centuries later and antigravity
        generations have enabled whole cities to lift off the surface of the
        earth to become galactic wanderers. In <em>Earthman, Come Home</em>, the
        nomadic cities revert to barbarism and marauding rogue cities begin to
        pose a threat to all civilized worlds. In the final novel,
        <em>The Triumph of Time</em>, history repeats itself as the cities once
        again journey back in to space making a terrifying discovery which could
        destroy the entire Universe. A serious and haunting vision of our world
        and its limits, <em>Cities in Flight</em> marks the return to print of
        one of science fiction‚Äôs most inimitable writers.

      I think what is most fascinating about Dune isn‚Äôt that it is so commonly
      read, but the ubiquity with which it is referenced. Once you read this,
      you start seeing Dune quotes everywhere. Dune is monumental in scope, and
      the cautionary tone in which it was written - this is what happens when
      you put faith in a single person trained scientifically - almost
      completely backfires in an amazing story of heroism, revenge, and
      reconciliation. A book worth reading multiple times. Of course, it is also
      a series - the first stands alone, and I haven‚Äôt read beyond the first
      two. There almost isn‚Äôt a need. Dune alone is that good. -

        This masterpiece of science (and mathematical) fiction is a delightfully

        Shakespearean scholar Edwin A. Abbott (1838-1926), it describes the
        journeys of A. Square, a mathematician and resident of the
        two-dimensional Flatland, where women‚Äîthin, straight lines‚Äîare the
        lowliest of shapes, and where men may have any number of sides,

        Through strange occurrences that bring him into contact with a host of
        geometric forms, Square has adventures in Spaceland (three dimensions),
        Lineland (one dimension) and Pointland (no dimensions) and ultimately
        entertains thoughts of visiting a land of four dimensions‚Äîa
        revolutionary idea for which he is returned to his two-dimensional

        Still in love (somewhat to his surprise and delight), they go on a
        Caribbean cruise to resume their marriage. Their vacation rapidly
        becomes a complex series of challenges, not the least of which are
        spies, aliens, and battles with pirates who capture the ship for ransom.
        There is no writer in SF like Gene Wolfe and no SF novel like

        Human and Oankali have been mating since the aliens first came to Earth
        to rescue the few survivors of an annihilating nuclear war. The Oankali
        began a massive breeding project, guided by the ooloi, a sexless

      interesting read. Like a lot of science fiction, I found it a bit hard to

        <em>Star Maker</em> is a science fiction novel by Olaf Stapledon,

        two billion years. <em>Star Maker</em> tackles philosophical themes such
        as the essence of life, of birth, decay and death, and the relationship
        between creation and creator. A pervading theme is that of progressive
        unity within and between different civilizations. Some of the elements
        and themes briefly discussed prefigure later fiction concerning genetic

        The third novel in the science-fiction trilogy by C. S. Lewis. This
        final story is set on Earth, and tells of a terrifying conspiracy
        against humanity. The story surrounds Mark and Jane Studdock, a newly
        married couple. Mark is a sociologist who is enticed to join an
        organization called N.I.C.E. which aims to control all human life. His
        wife, meanwhile, has bizarre prophetic dreams about a decapitated
        scientist, Alcasan. As Mark is drawn inextricably into the sinister
        organization, he discovers the truth of his wife‚Äôs dreams when he meets
        the literal head of Alcasan which is being kept alive by infusions of
        blood. Jane seeks help concerning her dreams at a community called
        St.¬†Anne‚Äôs, where she meets their leader‚ÄîDr.¬†Ransom (the main character
        of the previous two titles in the trilogy). The story ends in a final
        spectacular scene at the N.I.C.E. headquarters where Merlin appears to
        confront the powers of Hell.

      This is one of Arthur C. Clarke‚Äôs novels that is less about space and more
      about humanity, and the oceans. Clarke lived for a large part of his later
      life in Sri Lanka, and always loved the sea; in this book, that sentiment
      really comes out. I love it for that. It also has a nice view of ocean
      management, which is rare for books set in the future. -

      This is an incredible book. Absolutely incredible. The first section,
      about a son of a scientist, is a great example of Wolfe‚Äôs ability to make
      the future sound like the Victorian past, and to add decay to what, to our
      eyes, seems incredibly futuristic. The story about the traveler and the
      aborigines on Saint Croix is something I think about a lot - ‚Äúold men
      think long thoughts‚Äù, in particular, is a thought that I love, especially
      given its context. Gene Wolfe also uses the epistolary novel technique
      incredibly well in the third story. But the best part is how you come to
      realize that each of these stories is intertwined with the others, subtly.
      Amazing storytelling. -

        Gene Wolfe‚Äôs <em>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</em> is a universally
        acknowledged masterpiece of science fiction by one of the field‚Äôs most
        brilliant writers. Far out from Earth, two sister planets, Saint Anne
        and Saint Croix, circle each other in an eternal dance. It is said a
        race of shapeshifters once lived here, only to perish when men came. But
        one man believes they can still be found, somewhere in the back of the

        In <em>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</em>, Wolfe skillfully interweaves
        three bizarre tales to create a mesmerizing pattern: the harrowing
        account of the son of a mad genius who discovers his hideous heritage; a
        young man‚Äôs mythic dreamquest for his darker half; the bizarre chronicle
        of a scientists‚Äô nightmarish imprisonment. Like an intricate, braided

    <p>
      Neal Asher has written almost 20 books (if you include short story
      compilations) set within the universe of the Polity, an interstellar human
      civilization ruled by (mostly) benevolent AIs, all overseen by the most
      powerful AI of all: Earth Central. There are several distinct series
      within the larger Polity collection, as well as several standalone novels
      and short story collections. The <em>Ian Cormac</em> series follows a
      human agent of Earth Central as he investigates threats towards the
      Polity. The <em>Spatterjay</em> series explores the hostile world of
      Spatterjay and the lives of its hoopers: humans infected by an alien virus
      that grants its hosts functional immortality, immense strength, and
      incredible durability, but not without a cost. The
      <em>Transformations</em> series focuses on a rogue AI named Penny Royal
      capable of granting almost any wish, but its help is always a double-edged
      sword. His most recent series, <em>Rise of the Jain</em>, is about the
      re-emergence of an ancient and incredibly powerful alien race that
      disappeared after seeding the galaxy with technological seeds designed to
      destroy any intelligent civilization that came across one.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of Asher‚Äôs <em>Polity</em> novels are chock full of amazing
      technology, vibrant characters, picture-painting prose, and themes that
      explore the nature and limits of humanity. I was tempted to put this
      series under the Hard Sci-Fi category, as Asher introduces very few
      technologies that can‚Äôt be extrapolated from existing tech, but a few
      things (e.g.¬†FTL travel) and the distance in the future in which the
      series is set convinced me it should probably not be included in the
      ‚Äúhard‚Äù category. -

        humanity. He tells in passing of how a ‚ÄòQuiet War‚Äô replaced humans with
        the artificial intelligence and in doing so allowed humans more freedom
        than if they‚Äôd remained under their own governance. We get to see a
        world pre-Polity in The Line of the Polity and post-Polity twenty years
        later in The Technician, though the comparison is an aside to the
        storytelling.

      Unlike the crew of Trek‚Äôs <em>Enterprise</em>, the <em>Beagle</em> crew
      engage in power struggles between its civilian and military leaders. The
      plot of the third section is very reminiscent of the <em>Alien</em> movie.

        The book can be roughly divided into four sections corresponding to the
        four short stories on which it was based. In the first part, the
        <em>Space Beagle</em> is infiltrated by Coeurl, a starving, intelligent
        and vicious cat-like carnivore with tentacles on its shoulders. In the
        second, the ship is almost destroyed by internal warfare caused by
        telepathic contact with a race of bird-like aliens. The third features
        Ixtl, a scarlet alien that kidnaps several crew members in order to
        implant parasitic eggs in their stomachs. In the last section, the crew
        battles Anabis, a galaxy-spanning consciousness.

      Very interesting exploration of what happens when aliens arrive on earth,

      Stephen Baxter explores the Fermi Paradox in different ways over the

      scifi style. It is very thought provoking, and also utterly brutal and
      bleak. Space and time is cold and uncaring. -

      <p>
        Each one of the main novels deals with a possible resolution to the
        Fermi paradox. The first, Time, is set in a universe that is completely
        devoid of intelligent life beyond that of mankind and its creations
        (i.e.¬†A.I. and uplifted animals).
      </p>
      <p>
        The second in the series, Space, proposes the opposite: that life is
        endemic to the universe, and there is intelligence in nearly all
        possible places of the cosmos. The solution to the Fermi Paradox in this
        novel is that intelligent life is continually wiped out by cosmic
        disasters before it has time to spread too far.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third novel, Origin, is set in a multiverse that is a compromise
        between the ideals in the first two novels: that life is only on Earth,
        but at the same time is everywhere. This novel solves the Fermi Paradox
        by suggesting that intelligent life is segregated into separate parallel
        universes.

        For eons, sandstorms have swept the barren desolate landscape of the red

      This book is fantastic not for the novelty of non-technological
      teleportation, but because of the main character. What happens when
      someone who has been ignored by society finds himself in a position of
      power? This book reminds me a tiny bit of Ender‚Äôs Game - imagine what
      would happen if Mazer Rackham, another tattooed Maori hero, wanted more
      than to be a military genius. I loved it. I quote the poem to myself all
      the time, and have set a variant of it as my twitter bio for years now. -

      were created to maintain peace within the society. In this book you follow

      This is easily in one of my top 5 favorite books I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs SO
      fun to read, and every single person I‚Äôve recommended it to has loved it.
      Even if you don‚Äôt understand every single reference, it‚Äôs still a great
      story to follow. It has an excellent amount of humor, adventure, and
      nostalgia. It also has one of the best endings I‚Äôve ever read, which any
      reader knows is a hard thing to nail. Ernest Cline really hit it out of
      the park with this one. Highly recommend it. -

      This book is AWESOME. It‚Äôs so AWESOME that it makes me want to go back and
      play arcade games and rewatch all of the Macross saga. The plot is great,
      the writing is great, it makes you laugh out loud if you‚Äôre a geek and
      know the references, and the story is kickass. Warning: Might be a good
      idea to brush up on your old school fantasy and scifi before reading this.
      Just don‚Äôt go rewatch Krull, OK? -

      <p>It‚Äôs the year 2044, and the real world is an ugly place.</p>
      <p>
        Like most of humanity, Wade Watts escapes his grim surroundings by
        spending his waking hours jacked into the OASIS, a sprawling virtual
        utopia that lets you be anything you want to be, a place where you can
        live and play and fall in love on any of ten thousand planets.
      </p>
      <p>
        And like most of humanity, Wade dreams of being the one to discover the
        ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this virtual world.
        For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator
        James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield
        massive fortune‚Äîand remarkable power‚Äîto whoever can unlock them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize,
        knowing only that Halliday‚Äôs riddles are based in the pop culture he
        loved‚Äîthat of the late twentieth century. And for years, millions have
        found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy,
        obsessive study of Halliday‚Äôs icons. Like many of his contemporaries,
        Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes‚Äôs
        oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging
        power to run his OASIS rig.
      </p>
      <p>And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.</p>
      <p>
        Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join
        the hunt‚Äîamong them certain powerful players who are willing to commit
        very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade
        to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he
        may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up
        to life‚Äîand love‚Äîin the real world he‚Äôs always been so desperate to
        escape.
      </p>
      <p>A world at stake. A quest for the ultimate prize. Are you ready?</p>

        In a time not far from our own, Lawrence sets out simply to build an

      Set in the near future, the story follows a number of characters as their
      lives unfold living in an underground silo. Life underground seems quite
      grim, people have obviously been down there quite a while, and even though
      they seem to have quite advanced technology, it‚Äôs old and decaying. The
      engineers and mechanics do their best to keep the electricity throughout
      the 100 levels of the silo, it‚Äôs a lottery to see who gets to start a
      family as the population needs to be strictly controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It‚Äôs set close enough to the present that you can see how things could end
      up the way they are in the silo, the political structures, the way the
      silo is organized, the rivalry between the various levels and departments;
      but what happened to lead to humanity living this way in the first place?
      Why are they all down there, and what‚Äôs wrong with the surface?

        The year is 2380. The Intersolar Commonwealth, a sphere of stars some
        four hundred light-years in diameter, contains more than six hundred
        worlds, interconnected by a web of transport ‚Äútunnels‚Äù known as
        wormholes. At the farthest edge of the Commonwealth, astronomer Dudley
        Bose observes the impossible: Over one thousand light-years away, a
        star‚Ä¶ vanishes. It does not go supernova. It does not collapse into a
        black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to
        reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is
        dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a
        threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot
        whose glory days are centuries behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that
        believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they
        call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of
        sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship‚Äôs mission for
        its own ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are
        crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted.
        Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated.
        Soon enough, he will have other worries. A thousand light-years away,
        something truly incredible is waiting: a deadly discovery whose
        unleashing will threaten to destroy the Commonwealth‚Ä¶ and humanity
        itself. Could it be that Johansson was right?

      Alastair Reynolds‚Äô take on the Fermi Paradox is a vast and brutal epic,
      consisting of the three ‚Äúmain‚Äù books (forming the ‚ÄúInhibitor Trilogy‚Äù) and
      a few other books and novellas set in the same universe. Revelation Space
      is page-turning ‚Äúhard space opera‚Äù - believable but fantastic, and
      delightfully bizarre at times. -

        Nine hundred thousand years ago, something annihilated the Amarantin
        civilization just as it was on the verge of discovering space flight.
        Now one scientist, Dan Sylveste, will stop at nothing to solve the
        Amarantin riddle before ancient history repeats itself. With no other
        resources at his disposal, Sylveste forges a dangerous alliance with the

      Peter Hamilton is back with another story featuring a wormhole-based
      multi-planetary society, and this one has elements of both space opera and
      cyberpunk. The perspective shifts between 2204 and several thousand years
      into the future. Starts slow but when the shit hits the fan it hits with a
      vengeance. Three books in total, a very good read. -

        Winner of the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel and widely considered one
        of the most accomplished, powerful, and enduring classics of modern
        speculative fiction, Walter M. Miller, Jr.‚Äôs

        In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after
        sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly
        nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of
        the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here
        the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing
        through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human
        race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles
        and repeat its grievous mistakes. Seriously funny, stunning, and tragic,
        eternally fresh, imaginative, and altogether remarkable,
        <em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em> retains its ability to enthrall and

      <p>
        A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in
        the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to
        crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their
        destination is the coast, although they don‚Äôt know what, if anything,
        awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves
        against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are
        wearing, a cart of scavenged food‚Äîand each other. It boldly imagines a
        future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son,
        ‚Äúeach the other‚Äôs world entire,‚Äù are sustained by love. Winner of the
        2007 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.

      <p>
        This is the way the world ends: with a nanosecond of computer error in a
        Defense Department laboratory and a million casual contacts that form
        the links in a chain letter of death.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here is the bleak new world of the day after: a world stripped of
        its institutions and emptied of 99 percent of its people. A world in
        which a handful of panicky survivors choose sides‚Äîor are chosen. A world
        in which good rides on the frail shoulders of the 108-year-old Mother
        Abagail‚Äîand the worst nightmares of evil are embodied in a man with a
        lethal smile and unspeakable powers: Randall Flagg, the dark man.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1978 Stephen King published <em>The Stand</em>, the novel that is now
        considered to be one of his finest works. But as it was first published,
        <em>The Stand</em> was incomplete, since more than 150,000 words had
        been cut from the original manuscript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now Stephen King‚Äôs apocalyptic vision of a world blasted by plague and
        embroiled in an elemental struggle between good and evil has been
        restored to its entirety.
        <em>The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition</em> includes more than
        five hundred pages of material previously deleted, along with new
        material that King added as he reworked the manuscript for a new
        generation. It gives us new characters and endows familiar ones with new
        depths. It has a new beginning and a new ending. What emerges is a
        gripping work with the scope and moral complexity of a true epic.

      I‚Äôve lost count of the amount of times I have read <em>Ender‚Äôs Game</em>.
      I generally read it around once a year, at least. It is part of a larger
      series, including <em>Speaker for the Dead</em>, and <em>Xenocide</em> -
      follow-ups which build on <em>Ender‚Äôs Game</em> and which are, in their
      own right, great books. <em>EG</em> was originally just a short story, a
      kind of prequel to the themes spoken of in <em>Speaker for the Dead</em>.
      It shows Card‚Äôs talent that he was able to so fluently make it a
      stand-alone book.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love <em>Ender‚Äôs Game</em>. All things considered, this is not a book
      about emotional development, or about coming of age. It‚Äôs not about taking
      on the weight of the world. Rather, this is a book about strategy. More
      happens in the gaps between the pages than in the chapters themselves -
      taking the time to figure out how Ender worked out an advantage in a game
      room, and how you would have done it, is an incredibly rewarding
      experience. Every now and then, there is a wonderful feeling of ‚ÄòDamn, I
      wish I had done that! So smart.‚Äô And, as Card notes in the prologue:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Fiction, because it is not about somebody who actually lived in the real
        world, always has the possibility of being about ourself.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      So, you‚Äôre able to share in Ender‚Äôs cleverness, too. That‚Äôs what makes
      this book a fun read. -

      <p>
        In order to develop a secure defense against a hostile alien race‚Äôs next
        attack, government agencies breed child geniuses and train them as
        soldiers. A brilliant young boy‚ÄîAndrew ‚ÄúEnder‚Äù Wiggin‚Äîlives with his
        kind but distant parents, his sadistic brother Peter, and the person he
        loves more than anyone else, his sister Valentine. Peter and Valentine
        were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn‚Äôt make the
        cut‚Äîyoung Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for
        rigorous military training.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ender‚Äôs skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle
        Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing
        up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly
        from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult
        teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders. His
        psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like
        the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to
        his beloved sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of
        the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a
        hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway
        for almost as long. Ender‚Äôs two older siblings are every bit as unusual
        as he is, but in very different ways. Between the three of them lie the
        abilities to remake a world. If, that is, the world survives.

        Fifteen years from now, a new virus sweeps the globe. 95% of those
        afflicted experience nothing worse than fever and headaches. Four
        percent suffer acute meningitis, creating the largest medical crisis in
        history. And one percent find themselves ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù‚Äîfully awake and

        One per cent doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot. But in the United States, that‚Äôs
        1.7 million people ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù‚Ä¶ including the President‚Äôs wife and

        Spurred by grief and the sheer magnitude of the suffering, America
        undertakes a massive scientific initiative. Nothing can restore the
        ability to control their own bodies to the locked in. But then two new
        technologies emerge. One is a virtual-reality environment, ‚ÄúThe Agora,‚Äù
        in which the locked-in can interact with other humans, both locked-in
        and not. The other is the discovery that a few rare individuals have
        brains that are receptive to being controlled by others, meaning that
        from time to time, those who are locked in can ‚Äúride‚Äù these people and
        use their bodies as if they were their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        This skill is quickly regulated, licensed, bonded, and controlled.
        Nothing can go wrong. Certainly nobody would be tempted to misuse it,
        for murder, for political power, or worse‚Ä¶

        <em>Cryptonomicon</em> zooms all over the world, careening
        conspiratorially back and forth between two time periods‚ÄîWorld War II
        and the present. Our 1940s heroes are the brilliant mathematician
        Lawrence Waterhouse, cryptanalyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho,
        morphine-addicted marine Bobby Shaftoe. They‚Äôre part of Detachment 2702,
        an Allied group trying to break Axis communication codes while
        simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that their codes
        have been broken. Their job boils down to layer upon layer of deception.
        Dr.¬†Alan Turing is also a member of 2702, and he explains the unit‚Äôs
        strange workings to Waterhouse. ‚ÄúWhen we want to sink a convoy, we send
        out an observation plane first‚Ä¶ Of course, to observe is not its real
        duty‚Äîwe already know exactly where the convoy is. Its real duty is to be

        Waterhouse and the lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe‚Äîteam up to help
        create an offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some
        gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac tone of
        the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of Detachment 2702 and
        the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an unbreakable encryption scheme
        left over from WWII to befuddle the 1990s protagonists with
        conspiratorial ties.

      This is my favorite book. It is science fiction and, to a certain extent,
      fantasy, but at places reads more like a philosophical tract of a
      collection of stories. The plot is minimal, but the character of Severian
      is fascinating; he forgets nothing, but lies to you. As you read along, it
      becomes clear that earlier chapters were wrong or lacked important
      details, which heavily contributes to a sense of wonder and enchantment.
      Or, in my case, aw at Gene Wolfe‚Äôs writing abilities. Highly suggested. -

      This is debatably science fiction. I mention it here because certain

        While on holiday, Scott Carey is exposed to a cloud of radioactive spray
        shortly after he accidentally ingests insecticide. The radioactivity
        acts as a catalyst for the bug spray, causing his body to shrink at a
        rate of approximately 1/7 of an inch per day. A few weeks later, Carey
        can no longer deny the truth: not only is he losing weight, he is also
        shorter than he was and deduces, to his dismay, that his body will
        continue to shrink.

        It is the fourteenth century and one of the most apocalyptic events in
        human history is set to occur - the coming of the Black Death. History
        teaches us that a third of Europe‚Äôs population was destroyed. But what
        if? What if the plague killed 99 percent of the population instead? How
        would the world have changed? This is a look at the history that could
        have been: a history that stretches across centuries, a history that
        sees dynasties and nations rise and crumble, a history that spans
        horrible famine and magnificent innovation. These are the years of rice

      <p>
        Karl Glogauer is a disaffected modern professional casting about for
        meaning in a series of half-hearted relationships, a dead-end job, and a
        personal struggle. His questions of faith surrounding his father‚Äôs
        run-of-the-mill Christianity and his mother‚Äôs suppressed Judaism lead
        him to a bizarre obsession with the idea of the messiah. After the
        collapse of his latest affair and his introduction to a reclusive
        physics professor, Karl is given the opportunity to confront his
        obsession and take a journey that no man has taken before, and from
        which he knows he cannot return.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon arriving in Palestine, A.D. 29, Glogauer finds that Jesus Christ is
        not the man that history and faith would like to believe, but that there
        is an opportunity for someone to change the course of history by making
        the ultimate sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
        First published in 1969, <em>Behold the Man</em> broke through science
        fiction‚Äôs genre boundaries to create a poignant reflection on faith,
        disillusion and self-sacrifice. This is the classic novel that
        established the career of perhaps contemporary science fiction‚Äôs most
        cerebral and innovative author.

        wrong: their house is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.

        Of course, neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson
        nor his companion Karen Green was prepared to face the consequences of
        that impossibility, until the day their two little children wandered off
        and their voices eerily began to return another story‚Äîof creature
        darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that
        unholy growl which soon enough would tear through their walls and
        consume all their dreams.

      Hard-as-nails science fiction, but wonderfully fresh and imaginative
      (especially if you haven‚Äôt had a chance to read anything written by Greg
      Egan before.) The stories have aged surprisingly well ‚Äî which only
      underlines Egan‚Äôs penchant for sounding out the shape of the future. -

        <em>Axiomatic</em> is a collection of Greg Egan‚Äôs short stories that
        appeared in various science fiction magazines (mostly
        <em>Interzone</em> and <em>Asimov‚Äôs</em>) between 1989 and 1992. Like
        most of Egan‚Äôs work, the stories focus on science and ideas, sometimes
        at the expense of the writing. But although Egan may lack a certain
        stylistic flair, he more than makes up for it with his wonderful visions
        of the future. Some of the more interesting stories include
        <em>Into Darkness</em>, the tale of a rescue worker whose territory is a
        runaway wormhole, and the title story <em>Axiomatic</em>, which is about
        a man looking to find meaning in the senseless death of his wife.

        That <em>The Illustrated Man</em> has remained in print since being
        published in 1951 is fair testimony to the universal appeal of Ray
        Bradbury‚Äôs work. Only his second collection (the first was
        <em>Dark Carnival</em>, later reworked into
        <em>The October Country</em>), it is a marvelous, if mostly dark, quilt
        of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. In an ingenious framework to
        open and close the book, Bradbury presents himself as a nameless
        narrator who meets the Illustrated Man‚Äîa wanderer whose entire body is a
        living canvas of exotic tattoos. What‚Äôs even more remarkable, and
        increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves
        magically alive, and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as ‚ÄúThe
        Veldt,‚Äù wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over
        the edge. Or ‚ÄúKaleidoscope,‚Äù a heartbreaking portrait of stranded
        astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere‚Äîwithout the benefit of a
        spaceship. Or ‚ÄúZero Hour,‚Äù in which invading aliens have discovered a
        most logical ally‚Äîour own children. Even though most were written in the
        1940s and 1950s, these 18 classic stories will be just as chillingly
        effective 50 years from now. ‚ÄîStanley Wiater

      I think of these stories often; The Death of Dr.¬†Island won a Nebula and
      offers a startling view into the rehabilitation and justice system we
      currently deal with and what we might have. The Doctor of Death Island is
      the same - I often think of him taking off the book cover, ‚Äúlike
      Mephistopholes‚Äù. It takes an amazing talent to make three beautiful short
      stories out of permutations on a title. Also, Feather Tigers made me view
      the jungles in South East Asia a bit differently than I would have, and I
      think about Nashwonk a lot more than I should. I highly suggest this book.

      Very few films can stand up to as many rewatches as this film can - there
      are layers upon layers, and the bleak image of the future hasn‚Äôt lost its
      power in the thirty years the film has been around. This was a reworking
      of the Phillip K. Dick book (above), but without a lot of unnecessary or
      largely spurious subplots, and it focuses much more on identity,
      sexuality, and the psychological ramifications of technology. A
      masterpiece. -

      I was thinking that this movie would be like the rest of the movies
      starring Tom Cruise, but I was pleasantly surprised. The first half of the
      movie had nice humoristic scenes. They made the repeating of the day far
      more interesting than in the Groundhog Day. The love story between the
      main characters doesn‚Äôt look cheap. The visual effects is not in the

      In a strange loop, a lot of the statements made in this film about who
      hackers are have gone full circle and been incorporated into our culture
      (Substack‚Äôs ending most of his slides with ‚ÄòHack the planet‚Äô, for
      instance). The actual hacking is ridiculous, but the punks on the edge of
      society coming into their own makes this worth watching. -

      different ramifications of how Mr.¬†Nobody‚Äôs life would have been if he had
      made different choices or if different things happened around him. What‚Äôs
      best of this movie is that each of these <strong>lifes</strong> is
      completely different (and
      <strong>would have been equally meaningful</strong> :D) which means a lot
      of stuff is happening all the time and you have to follow what is going on
      now in this life, how it relates to its past which is probably another
      life shown in the movie and it‚Äôs the common past of several of the lives
      you‚Äôll see. At the same time you have to understand the common theme of
      the movie, which I think it is what is trying to communicate after all.
      The end is surprising and difficult to grasp at first. The film also makes
      substantial use of chaos theory and the butterfly effect to accentuate the
      lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses -

      This is a fairly accurate representation of the awesome book, but it
      focuses much more on Watney‚Äôs personality than on the science (which is a

      absolutely beautiful. This film had great actors, marvelously cast. And

      This show. Watch this show. It‚Äôs military science fiction done right. The
      interpersonal relationships are the best part, and the constant
      questioning of what it means to be human. At times it is a bit heavy
      handed. At other times it paints humanity as a desperate and stupid
      species, but at least it does so faithfully and self-referentially. The

      In contrast to the setting of the other Star Trek TV shows, DS9 takes
      place on a space station instead of a starship. This made continuing story
      arcs and appearance of recurring characters much more feasible. The show
      is noted for well-developed characters, originality, complex plots,
      religious themes and for starring the only black captain of all the Star
      Trek series to be featured as the show‚Äôs protagonist. The series often
      showcased darker themes, less physical exploration of space, and (in later
      seasons) an emphasis on many aspects of war. -

      A science-fiction masterpiece, Star Trek has been a really important
      vision not only of what future technology could look like, but also a
      reflection of what the hopes were, especially in the 60‚Äôs, for what human
      society could look like.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Original Series, in many ways, is Star Trek at its purest. It‚Äôs true
      that it could be campy and slow, but don‚Äôt mistake that for it being
      unsophisticated. It was very smartly written, and while it can vary wildly
      in quality (like many shows from the 60‚Äôs) it has a solid philosophical
      core, and often had some interesting things to say.
    </p>

      Plus, I‚Äôm not sure the franchise has ever quite topped the amazing
      chemistry between Shatner, Nimoy, and Kelly. It‚Äôs worth watching for them

      social issues like LGBTQ rights, social media and religion. The characters
      are interesting and relatable, since they talk and behave like real,

      One of the most influential french sci-fi comics. It inspired a lot of
      what became Heavy Metal Magazine. Moebius in this onirical tale uses no
      words to this graphical prose. -

      Black Science is one of those stories where you explain it to people at a
      really high level and gradually get more excited as you do so. It‚Äôs
      essentially what happens if Rick &amp; Morty had a less skilled and lucky
      Rick. Grant McKay goes through some really dark experiences, and the
      multiverse around him feels nothing for his plight. It‚Äôs a story to read
      and revisit. -

        Grant McKay, former member of The Anarchistic Order of Scientists, has
        finally done the impossible: He has deciphered Black Science and punched
        through the barriers of reality. But what lies beyond the veil is not
        epiphany, but chaos. Now Grant and his team are lost, living ghosts
        shipwrecked on an infinite ocean of alien worlds, barreling through the
        long-forgotten, ancient, and unimaginable dark realms. The only way is
        forward. The only question is how far are they willing to go, and how
        much can they endure, to get home again? Join writer RICK REMENDER and
        the superstar art team of MATTEO SCALERA &amp; DEAN WHITE for this
        face-melting science fiction epic spanning the lifetimes of a cast of
        dimensional castaways lead by the man who caused it all.

      Saga is a comic that is an elevator pitch proof. It‚Äôs impossible to
      describe it in a sentence. All I can say is that it‚Äôs a beautifully
      written and drawn story about love and family, in a very interesting space
      opera-like world. It‚Äôs kinda like Star Wars, but not at all. While in Star
      Wars the heroes are in a huge journey to end the war, in Saga they just
      want to be left alone to live with their family. -

      Highly imaginative, hilarious, sprawling epic graphic novel ‚Äî a
      collaboration between two giants of weird storytelling. Jodorowsky is an
      auteur of avant-garde film, and M≈ìbius is a legendary cartoonist; together
      their work has been a huge influence on such classic films as Alien, Tron,
      and Star Wars. The story is all kinds of preposterous, a dazzling display
      of surrealist science fiction, and the illustrations render it
      way-larger-than-life on the page. This single-volume collection of the
      complete series is well-worth the read. -
