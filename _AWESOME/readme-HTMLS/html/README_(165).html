      The Microsoft Build Engine is a platform for building applications. This
      engine, which is also known as MSBuild, provides an XML schema for a
      project file that controls how the build platform processes and builds
      software. Visual Studio uses MSBuild, but it doesn’t depend on Visual
      Studio. By invoking msbuild.exe on your project or solution file, you can
      orchestrate and build products in environments where Visual Studio isn’t
      installed<br />
