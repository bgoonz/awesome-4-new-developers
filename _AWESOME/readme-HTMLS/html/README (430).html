    <p>A curated list of awesome radio resources. Inspired by awesome-*.</p>
    <p>
      I recently pulled out my CB radio and installed it in my truck. This
      inspired me to create an open source repository of all the radio related
      resources I found helpful and my notes on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project is aimed at hackers who enjoy all aspects of radio
      communication. While a lot of this technology isn’t usable by citizens and
      is heavily regulated by the FCC, just knowing anything about it is
      special. I’ve been interested in learning the ins and outs of radio, as
      well as hearing stories, new and old.

    <h2 id="cb">CB</h2>
    <p>
      Citizens band radio, or CB, is a two way radio spectrum dedicated to open
      use by anyone for almost any purpose. In the US and many other countries,
      it does not require a license to operate. CB consists of 40 channels
      between 26.965 MHz and 27.405 MHz with channel 09 being dedicated to
      emergencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      CB is more popular among truckers and radio enthusiasts, but its
      usefulness does not stop there. It’s great for long distance travel on
      popular trucking routes. You can tune to channel 19 (an unofficial
      trucker’s channel) and get real time traffic updates, alternate routes and
      accident warnings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a good antenna that’s properly tuned, a typical range to expect out
      of your CB is about 2 - 5 miles (3.2 - 8 kilometers).
    </p>
    <h3 id="general-use">General Use</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve found a lot of my information on Jeep and trucker forums. From my own
      experience, it seems about half the CB transmission I hear include a
      handle of some kind. I also hear a lot of swearing, so I wouldn’t sweat
      accidentally letting a “fuck” or a “shit” go.
    </p>
    <p>
      CB is public. Very public. That seems like a “no shit” kind of thing, but
      with the current generation pretty much only using cell phones, it’s easy
      to forget that using something as “primitive” as a CB radio is essentially
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_band_radio#Working_skip"
        >broadcast to the world</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truckers tend to use channel 19. This is a good channel to monitor for
      traffic conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Channel 9 is for emergencies only. No general chatter on this channel. If
      you are broke down, or your car catches fire, besides calling 911, this is
      a good channel to transmit on for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around Portland, I hear a lot of chatter on channels 6, 17 and 28. These
      are good channels for entertaining conversation.

    <h3 id="swr">SWR</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave_ratio">SWR</a>, or
      Standing Wave Ratio is a measurement of efficiency when connecting your
      antenna to your radio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Optimum ratio is 1:1, although you’ll probably end up with 1.3:1 or so.
      Anything higher than 2:1 should be considered a no-no since it can damage
      your radio and give poor transmission. Read up on

      Installing your CB right is key to A) not damaging your radio hardware and
      B) getting good range and quality on both the receiving and transmitting
      ends.

    <p>
      Software Defined Radio is a way to define components that are typically
      hardware, such as filters and amplifiers, as software. It has been around
      for a while, but with the cost of digital electronics needed to run SDR
      becoming increasingly cheaper, we are seeing a rise in hacker folk playing
      and building with SDR.

      Once you’re more comfortable, you can also just use GNURadio to do any
      device tuning, setup and i/o, and then use numpy for the signal
      manipulation math.

    <h2 id="amateur-radio-a.k.a-ham-radio">Amateur Radio (a.k.a Ham Radio)</h2>
    <p>
      The hobby of Amateur Radio has a long and proud tradition. The very first
      radio amateurs were true pioneers of radio technology. Amateurs ‘invented’
      and refined much of the early radio technology and were the first to
      transmit music, radio plays, and information to the handful of people who
      had the new fangled radio receivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After World War II the hobby of amateur radio flourished. Radio clubs
      sprang up in schools all over the world and kids went home each night to
      build some new contraption, or have a chat with someone over the wireless.
      These young people became the mainstay of the technical professions and
      developed much of the modern technology we use today. (<a

      Police and fire in the United States typically communicate over trunked
      radio. This makes it hard to scan using normal reciever without trunk
      tracking abilities. See more in the
      <a href="#trunking">trunking</a> section.

    <h3 id="trunking">Trunking</h3>
    <p>
      While not strictly specific to public health and safety, it is usually the
      first thing that comes to mind when talking about trunked radio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trunked radio is a form of digital-two-way communication where multiple
      organizations can share a small spectrum of real frequencies without
      hearing another organizations conversations. A user can choose a logical
      channel or group and the base station will find an empty frequency to
      transmit on.
