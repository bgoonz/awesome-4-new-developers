      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>You know Python.</strong> (At least the basics! If you want to
        learn more Python,
        <a href="https://github.com/hangtwenty/python-is-for-lovers">try this</a
        >)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I learned Python by hacking first, and getting serious <em>later.</em> I
      wanted to do this with Machine Learning. If this is your style, join me in
      getting a bit ahead of yourself.
    </p>
    <h1 id="lets-get-started">Let’s get started</h1>
    <p>
      I suggest you get your feet wet to start. You’ll boost your confidence.
    </p>
    <h2 id="tools-youll-need">Tools you’ll need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. Python 3 is the best
        option.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython and the Jupyter Notebook</a>. (FKA
        IPython and IPython Notebook.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Some scientific computing packages:
        <ul>
          <li>numpy</li>
          <li>pandas</li>
          <li>scikit-learn</li>
          <li>matplotlib</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can install Python 3 and all of these packages in a few clicks with
      the
      <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/"
        >Anaconda Python distribution</a
      >. Anaconda is popular in Data Science and Machine Learning communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re using Python 2.7, don’t worry. You don’t have to migrate to
      Python 3 just for this guide. Also, if you’re using pip/virtualenv instead
      of Anaconda, that’s alright too! And re: installing packages, this is a
      helpful doc:

      by
      <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/">Prof. Pedro Domingos</a
      >. It’s densely packed with valuable information, but not opaque. The
      author understands that there’s a lot of “black art” and folk wisdom, and
      they invite you in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take your time with this one. Take notes. Don’t worry if you don’t
      understand it all yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole paper is packed with value, but I want to call out two points:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Data alone is not enough.</strong> This is where science meets
        art in machine-learning. Quoting Domingos: “… the need for knowledge in
        learning should not be surprising. Machine learning is not magic; it
        can’t get something from nothing. What it does is get more from less.
        Programming, like all engineering, is a lot of work: we have to build
        everything from scratch. Learning is more like farming, which lets
        nature do most of the work. Farmers combine seeds with nutrients to grow
        crops. Learners combine knowledge with data to grow programs.”
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>More data beats a cleverer algorithm.</strong> Listen up,
        programmers. We like cool tools. Resist the temptation to reinvent the
        wheel, or to over-engineer solutions. Your starting point is to
        <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest3.html"
          >Do the Simplest Thing that Could <em>Possibly</em> Work</a
        >. Quoting Domingos: “Suppose you’ve constructed the best set of
        features you can, but the classifiers you’re getting are still not
        accurate enough. What can you do now? There are two main choices: design
        a better learning algorithm, or gather more data. […] As a rule of
        thumb, a dumb algorithm with lots and lots of data beats a clever one
        with modest amounts of it. (After all, machine learning is all about
        letting data do the heavy lifting.)”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you work on a real Machine Learning problem, you should focus your
      efforts on your <strong>domain knowledge</strong> and
      <strong>data</strong> before optimizing your choice of algorithms. Prefer
      to <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?DoSimpleThings">Do Simple Things</a> until
      you <em>have</em> to increase complexity. You should not rush into neural
      networks because you think they’re cool. To improve your model,
      <strong>get more data.</strong> Then use your knowledge of the problem to
      <a
        href="https://www.thetalkingmachines.com/episodes/software-and-statistics-machine-learning"
        >explore and process</a
      >
      the data. You should only optimize the choice of algorithms after you have
      gathered enough data, and you’ve processed it well.

      It’s helpful if you decide on a pet project to play around with, as you
      go, so you have a way to apply your knowledge. You could use one of these

    </p>
    <p>
      Also, you should grab an in-depth textbook to use as a reference. The two
      best options are
      <a

        … Bayesian ideas have had a big impact in machine learning in the past
        20 years or so because of the flexibility they provide in building
        structured models of real world phenomena. Algorithmic advances and
        increasing computational resources have made it possible to fit rich,
        highly structured models which were previously considered intractable.

      <p>
        Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building
        complex systems quickly. This paper argues that it is dangerous to think
        of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the framework of technical
        debt, we note that it is remarkably easy to incur massive ongoing
        maintenance costs at the system level when applying machine learning.
        The goal of this paper is highlight several machine learning specific
        risk factors and design patterns to be avoided or refactored where
        possible. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback
        loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, changes in the external
        world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.

    <p>
      So you are dabbling with Machine Learning. You’ve got Hacking Skills.
      Maybe you’ve got some “knowledge” in Domingos’ sense (some “Substantive
      Expertise” or “Domain Knowledge”). This diagram is modified slightly from
      Drew Conway’s “Data Science Venn Diagram.” It isn’t a <em>perfect</em> fit
      for us, but it may get the point across:

      /></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please</strong> don’t sell yourself as a Machine Learning expert
      while you’re still in the Danger Zone. Don’t build bad products or publish
      junk science. (Also please
      <a

        >don’t be evil</a
      >.) This guide can’t tell you how you’ll know you’ve “made it” into
      Machine Learning competence … let alone expertise. It’s hard to evaluate
      proficiency without schools or other institutions. This is a common
      problem for self-taught people.
    </p>
    <h4 id="towards-expertise">Towards Expertise</h4>
    <p>
      You need <strong>practice.</strong>
      <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10508565"
        >On Hacker News, user olympus commented to say you could use
        competitions to practice and evaluate yourself</a
      >. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions">Kaggle</a> and
      <a href="http://www.chalearn.org/">ChaLearn</a> are hubs for Machine
      Learning competitions. You can find some
      <a href="https://github.com/apeeyush/machine-learning"
        >examples of code for popular Kaggle competitions here</a
      >. For smaller exercises,
      <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/ai/machine-learning/page/1"
        >try HackerRank</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also need <strong>understanding.</strong> You should review what
      Kaggle competition winners say about their solutions,
      <a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/">for example, the “No Free Hunch” blog</a
      >. These might be over your head at first but once you’re starting to
      understand and appreciate these, you know you’re getting somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Competitions and challenges are just one way to practice. You shouldn’t
      limit yourself, though - and you should also understand that
      <a
        href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/19/machine-learning-isnt-kaggle-competitions"
        >Machine Learning isn’t <strong>all</strong> about Kaggle
        competitions</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s a complementary way to practice:
      <strong>do practice studies.</strong>
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>Ask a question. Start your own study.</strong> The
        <a

          >“most important thing in data science is the question”</a
        >
        (<a href="https://github.com/jtleek">Dr. Jeff T. Leek</a>). So start
        with a question. Then, find
        <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets"
          >real data</a
        >. Analyze it. Then …
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Communicate results.</strong> When you have a novel finding,
        reach out for peer review.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Fix issues.</strong> Learn. Share what you learn.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And repeat. Re-phrasing this, it fits with the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method"
        >scientific method</a
      >: formulate a question (or problem statement), create a hypothesis,
      gather data, analyze the data, and communicate results. (You should
      <a
        href="http://101.datascience.community/2012/06/27/the-data-scientific-method/"
        >watch this video about the scientific method in data science</a

        href="http://customerthink.com/getting-insights-using-data-science-skills-and-the-scientific-method/"
        >read this article</a
      >.)
    </p>
    <p>
      How can you come up with interesting questions? Here’s one way. Every
      Sunday,
      <a href="https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets"
        >browse datasets</a
      >
      and write down some questions. Also, sign up for
      <a href="https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural">Data is Plural</a>, a
      newsletter of interesting datasets; look at these, datasets, and write
      down questions. Stay curious. When a question inspires you, start a study.
    </p>
    <p>
      This advice, to do practice studies and learn from peer review, is based
      on

        I think the best advice is to tell people to always present their
        methods clearly and to avoid over-interpreting their results. Part of
        being an expert is knowing that there’s rarely a clear answer,
        especially when you’re working with real data.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As you repeat this process, your practice studies will become more
      scientific, interesting, and focused. The most important part of this
      process is peer review.
    </p>
    <h4 id="ask-for-peer-review">Ask for Peer Review</h4>
    <p>Here are some communities where you can reach out for peer review:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/"
          >Cross-Validated: stats.stackexchange.com</a

          >Hacker News: news.ycombinator.com</a
        >. You’ll probably want to submit as “Show HN”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Post to any of those, and ask for feedback. You’ll get feedback. You’ll
      learn a ton. As experts review your work you will learn a lot about the
      field. You’ll also be practicing a crucial skill: accepting critical
      feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I read the feedback on my Pull Requests, first I repeat to myself, “I
      will not get defensive, I will not get defensive, I will not get
      defensive.” You may want to do that before you read reviews of your
      Machine Learning work too.

    <p>Machine Learning can be powerful, but it is not magic.</p>
    <p>
      Whenever you apply Machine Learning to solve a problem, you are going to
      be working in some specific problem domain. To get good results, you or
      your team will need “substantive expertise” AKA “domain knowledge.” Learn
      what you can, for yourself… But you should also
      <strong>collaborate.</strong> You’ll have better results if you
      collaborate with domain experts. (What’s a domain expert? See the

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#Applications"
        ><em>surrounded</em></a
      >
      by software that utilizes Machine Learning. Often, the results are
      directly user-facing, and intended to enhance UX.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before you start working ML into <em>your</em> software, you should get a
      better understanding of UX, as well as how ML and UX can relate. As an
      informal way to get into this subject, start with this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then, if you you know a coworker or friend who works in UX, take them out
      for coffee or lunch and pick their brain. I think they’ll have words of
      encouragement as well as caution. You won’t be an expert by any means, but
      maybe it’ll help you konw if/when to reach out for help, review, or
      guidance.

    <p>
      In early editions of this guide, there was no specific “Deep Learning”
      section. I omitted it intentionally. I think it is not effective for us to
      jump too far ahead. I also know that if you become an expert in
      traditional Machine Learning, you’ll be capable of moving onto advanced
      subjects like Deep Learning, whether or not I’ve put that in this guide.
      We’re just trying to get you started here!
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe this is a way to check your progress: ask yourself, does Deep
      Learning seem like magic? If so, take that as a sign that you aren’t ready
      to work with it professionally. Let the fascination motivate you to learn
      more. I have read some argue you can learn Deep Learning in isolation; I
      have read others recommend it’s best to master traditional Machine
      Learning first. Why not start with traditional Machine Learning, and
      develop your reasoning and intuition there? You’ll only have an easier
      time learning Deep Learning after that. After all of it, you’ll able to
      tackle all sorts of interesting problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, when you decide you’re ready to dive into Deep Learning, here
      are some helpful resources.

        People like you will do exciting things with TensorFlow. It’s a
        framework. Frameworks can help you manage complexity. Just remember this
        rule of thumb:
        <strong>“More data beats a cleverer algorithm”</strong> (Domingos), no
        matter how cool your tools are. Also note, TensorFlow is not the only
        machine learning framework of its kind:
