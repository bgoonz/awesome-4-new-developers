      Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include
      reusable R functions, the documentation that describes how to use them,
      and sample data. In this section you’ll learn how to turn your code into
      packages that others can easily download and use. Writing a package can
      seem overwhelming at first. So start with the basics and improve it over
      time. It doesn’t matter if your first version isn’t perfect as long as the
      next version is better.

      This practical guide provides more than 150 recipes to help you generate
      high-quality graphs quickly, without having to comb through all the
      details of R’s graphing systems. Each recipe tackles a specific problem
      with a solution you can apply to your own project, and includes a
      discussion of how and why the recipe works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the recipes use the ggplot2 package, a powerful and flexible way
      to make graphs in R. If you have a basic understanding of the R language,
      you’re ready to get started.
