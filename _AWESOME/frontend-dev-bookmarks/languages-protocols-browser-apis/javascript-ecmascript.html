            >: In Promise-based asynchronous code, rejections are used for error
            handling. One risk is that rejections may get lost, leading to
            silent failures. +

              ></strong
            >: In this brief article Sven Slootweg provides a better explanation
            of what Promise.try is, and why you should always use it, without
            exceptions. +

              ></strong
            >: The point of promises is to represent the eventual resulting
            value from an operation, but the reason to use them is to better
            parallel synchronous operations and to solve the callback hell.
