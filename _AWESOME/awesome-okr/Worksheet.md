1. **What is your company mission?**
   - You should already have a mission.
   - Take the time to set a company mission
2. **What is the theme for the year going to be, the one big objective you (as a company) would like to accomplish?**
3. **What are three metrics that would tell you that you had indeed succeeded in that objective ?**
4. Check:
   - Is the Objective inspirational and challenging?
   - Are these tough KRs?
   - Do you have only a 50/50 chance of making each KR?
   - Will it really take a year to do this?
   - Does it tie together everyone’s efforts?
5. **What is one big objective toward your company mission that would take the company 3 months to do, and you are only 50% confident you could do?**
   - Gather ideas for this from team.
   - Successful OKRS are set together, not handed down.

   - Is the Objective inspirational and challenging?
   - Are these tough KRs?
   - Do you have only a 50/50 chance of making each KR?
   - Will it really take an entire quarter to do this?  
     -Does it tie together everyone’s efforts?

#### For each group/function, i.e. marketing, engineering, product, design

1. **What Objective and three Key Results will you set to support the company OKR?**
2. Check:
   - Are these things you can do without support of other groups?
   - Are your results actually results, or are they tasks you do to get results?
     - e.g. Launch a pricing page vs launch a pricing page that has 12% conversion to contact.
   - CEO: do you really believe these will take a full quarter and each KR has only a 50/50 chance of success?
3. **What Objective and three Key Results will you PERSONALLY set to support the company OKR this quarter?**
   - e.g learn new skills, hire great people, show results in your pet project
4. **What big projects are needed to make this happen?**
   - It becomes the **roadmap**.
   - They are tasks
   - List as many as you wish
   - You can reorder them as often as needed through the quarter to hit the OKRs
   - OKRs don’t change (strategy) but projects and priorities do (tactics). [Validation](http://eleganthack.com/customer-development-with-participatory-roadmaps/)
