# ðŸ’¡ Actions Idea List

This is a list of ideas of actions and workflows that people would like to see one day.

If you would like to contribute to this, please feel free to add something! We only ask that you first check to see if the action already exists before doing so.

## Ideas

- Stargazer Threshold action - continue through a workflow after a certain number of stars is passed (every 100 stars, every 500 stars, etc)
- Twitter Action - Tweet out content
- Iteration Manager - When issues are added to a milestone, add to an iteration plan issue in the repo automatically.
- Issue Reproducer - Set up infrastructure to try reproducing code workflows to try verifying bugs
- Image optimizer - When PRs are opened with static image assets, optimize them before merging
- Puppeteer swarm - Spin up various instances Puppeteer with different viewports and take screenshots to see previews of websites
- Lighthouse action - Setup Lighthouse tool to run website audits in CI (Not allow merges / deploys to production environments if lighthouse score drops)
- VPN - allow to connect to a private network and deploy artifacts, trigger hooks, and do other stuff on a internal service
