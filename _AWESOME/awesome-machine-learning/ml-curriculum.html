      How would your curriculum for a machine learning beginner look like?
    </h1>
    <p>
      If I had to put together a study plan for a beginner, I would probably
      start with an easy-going intro course such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Andrew Ng’s
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning"
          >Machine Learning Course on Coursera</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Next, I would recommend a good intro book on ‘Data Mining’ (data mining is
      essentially about extracting knowledge from data, mainly using machine
      learning algorithms). I can highly recommend the following book written by
      one of my former professors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        P.-N. Tan, M. Steinbach, and V. Kumar.
        <a href="https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar/dmbook/index.php"
          >Introduction to Data Mining</a
        >, (Second Edition).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This book will provide you with a great overview of what’s currently out
      there; you will not only learn about different machine learning
      techniques, but also learn how to “understand” and “handle” and interpret
      data – remember; without “good,” informative data, a machine learning
      algorithm is practically worthless. Additionally, you will learn about
      alternative techniques since machine learning is not always the only and
      best solution to a problem
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail …</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Now, After completing the Coursera course, you will have a basic
      understanding of ML and broadened your understanding via the Data Mining
      book. I don’t want to self-advertise here, but I think my book would be a
      good follow-up to learn ML in more depth, understand the algorithms, learn
      about different data processing pipelines and evaluation techniques, best
      practices, and learn how to put in into action using Python, NumPy,
      scikit-learn, and Theano so that you can start working on your personal
      projects.
    </p>

      While you work on your individual projects, I would maybe deepen your
      (statistical learning) knowledge via one of the three below:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani, J. Friedman, T. Hastie, J. Friedman, and R.
        Tibshirani.
        <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/"
          >The Elements of Statistical Learning</a
        >, volume 2. Springer, 2009.
      </li>
      <li>
        C. M. Bishop et al. <a
          href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387310732"
          >Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a
        >, volume 1. Springer New York, 2006.
      </li>
      <li>
        Duda, Richard O., Peter E. Hart, and David G. Stork.
        <a
          href="https://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471056693.html"
          >Pattern Classification</a
        >. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When you are through all of that and still hungry to learn more, I
      recommend
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~bengioy/dlbook/"
            >The Deep Learning book</a
          >
          by Yoshua Bengio, Ian Goodfellow, and Aaron Courville. The release
          date is set around 2016, but the 613-page manuscript is already
          available as as of today (online and for free).

          And in-between, if you are looking for a less technical yet very
          inspirational free-time read, I highly recommend

            Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World</a
