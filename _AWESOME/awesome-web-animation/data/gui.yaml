    description: 'Now that we can use CSS transitions in all the modern browsers, let’s 
    make them pretty. I love the classic Penner equations with Flash and jQuery, so I 
    included most of those. If you’re anything like me*, you probably thought this about 
    the default easing options: “ease-in, ease-out...yawn.” The mysterious cubic-bezier 
    has a lot of potential, but was cumbersome to use. Until now. Also, touch-device friendly!'
