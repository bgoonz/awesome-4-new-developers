    <h3 id="what-is-discord.com-exactly">What is Discord.com exactly?</h3>
    <p>
      From
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)">Wikipedia</a>:
      &gt; Discord is a proprietary freeware VoIP application and digital
      distribution platform designed for creating communities ranging from
      gamers to education and businesses. Discord specializes in text, image,
      video and audio communication between users in a chat channel. Discord
      runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in web browsers. As of 21
      July 2019, there are over 250 million users of the software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or as I once heard from a critique: &gt; Discord is just IRC with extra
      features.
    </p>
    <p>A <em>server</em> in Discord mainly refers to the community itself.</p>
    <h3 id="what-about-discords-poor-privacy-policy">
      What about Discord’s poor privacy policy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It has been raised many times about the
      <a
        href="https://swordfishevaluations.com/2019/09/12/privacy-concerns-with-discord/"
        >awful privacy control</a
      >,
      <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html"
        >being a potential spyware</a
      >,
      <a href="https://stallman.org/discord.html"
        >criticism by Richard Stallman</a
      >, and
      <a
        href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-where-teens-rule-and-parents-fear-to-tread-11560245402"
        >risks of online predators</a
      >
      on a national newspaper. As much as I’d like to hate Discord because of
      this, it’s hard to deny the wonderful growing communities that are no less
      productive than their counterparts in another privacy-focused platform.
      That alone encouraged me to create this list.
    </p>
    <h3 id="how-to-stay-safe-in-discord">How to stay safe in Discord?</h3>
    <p>
      Discord has a spiffy guide for
      <a
        href="https://discord.com/new/safety/360043857751-Four-steps-to-a-super-safe-account"
        >staying safe in communities</a

      and
      <a
        href="https://discord.com/new/safety/360044153831-Helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-Discord"
        >for your teenage kids</a
      >. Like any other platform, Discord is often targeted for malicious
      attacks, but with a little caution, you’ll be safe as houses.

    <h3 id="how-is-this-list-any-different-from-discord-listing-sites">
      How is this list any different from Discord listing sites?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You may have come around websites that are known for listing Discord
      communities for showcasing and promotional purposes. This list is not one
      of them. Each community here is hand-picked, reviewed by a maintainer, and
      meets <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md#review-policy">certain criteria</a>, e.g.,
      activity vs. productivity ratio, the support channels dedicated to users,
      friendliness – before they can be accepted, whereas the listing websites
      often require servers to link closed-source bots that may collect user
      data and no manual review against possible toxic communities.
    </p>
    <h3 id="are-you-or-is-this-project-affiliated">
      Are you or is this project affiliated?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Neither I nor any part of this project is affiliated with Discord in any
      way.
    </p>
    <h3 id="why-does-this-list-not-follow-conventional-awesome-list-framework">
      Why does this list not follow conventional Awesome list framework?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was intentional since the very first
      <a
        href="https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities/commit/303990bcd36e4b10b4dfa80289c8303778d54f07"
        >commit</a
      >. Unlike other listings in Awesome lists, Discord communities are much
      more diverse, asymmetrical, and miscellaneous. E.g., the community
      <a href="https://gamedevleague.com/">Game Dev League</a> and
      <a href="https://twitter.com/gamedevnetwork_">Game Dev Network</a> are
      both independent and prominent, neither of them offers only one type of
      support. Rather, any general support relating to game development. A
      one-liner description would seem vague to the users. The differences that
      stand between the two servers are their channels and the spoken languages
      that they offer. This is true for 53% of all communities, but the channels
      don’t always necessarily explain “what this community is.” It was the
      biggest challenge to making this list. Instead of a description to define
      a community alongside its channels, languages, and at the same time to not
      condense the list – <a href="badges.md">badges</a> were adopted, notably,
      the <a href="badges.md#home-badge">home badge</a>, which on click takes
      you to the community-owned website. Other badges serve relevant features
      as well. Feel free to

      How to properly attribute to compliment the license (CC BY 4.0)?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I understand
      <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-BY-4.0</a> isn’t
      the best open-source license, the only restriction is: it requires the
      user to attribute the owner. By mentioning the name
      <code>awesome-discord-communities</code> (along with its GitHub
      <a href="https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities">link</a>)
      anywhere on a separate attribution page or on the same page where you have
      used the list is enough and meets the proper validity in my eyes.
