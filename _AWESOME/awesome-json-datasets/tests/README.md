Before you ask why a `markdown` file needs a `test`, let me explain.

After reading [Sindre's](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus) contributing [guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md) I wanted to abide by his rules.

When I started to put this list together I kept leaving trailing whitespace. I figured this would be the best way to remind ourselves that trailing whitespace is **bad**. When others contribute, it will also help me from accidentally merging trailing whitespace.
