# --description--

In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles could be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.

There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids: 1x1: 1 2x1: 4 3x1: 8 1x2: 4 2x2: 18

Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles could be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.

How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller grids?

# --hints--

`euler147()` should return 846910284.

```js
assert.strictEqual(euler147(), 846910284);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function euler147() {

  return true;
}
