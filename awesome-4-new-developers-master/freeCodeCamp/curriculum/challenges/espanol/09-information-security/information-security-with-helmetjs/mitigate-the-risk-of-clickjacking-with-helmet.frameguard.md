# --description--

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project on [Replit](https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec), or cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/).

Your page could be put in a `<frame>` or `<iframe>` without your consent. This can result in clickjacking attacks, among other things. Clickjacking is a technique of tricking a user into interacting with a page different from what the user thinks it is. This can be obtained executing your page in a malicious context, by mean of iframing. In that context a hacker can put a hidden layer over your page. Hidden buttons can be used to run bad scripts. This middleware sets the X-Frame-Options header. It restricts who can put your site in a frame. It has three modes: DENY, SAMEORIGIN, and ALLOW-FROM.

We donâ€™t need our app to be framed.

# --instructions--

Use `helmet.frameguard()` passing with the configuration object `{action: 'deny'}`.

# --hints--

helmet.frameguard() middleware should be mounted correctly

```js
(getUserInput) =>
  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/app-info').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.include(
        data.appStack,
        'frameguard',
        'helmet.frameguard() middleware is not mounted correctly'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

helmet.frameguard() 'action' should be set to 'DENY'

```js
(getUserInput) =>
  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/app-info').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.property(data.headers, 'x-frame-options');
      assert.equal(data.headers['x-frame-options'], 'DENY');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
