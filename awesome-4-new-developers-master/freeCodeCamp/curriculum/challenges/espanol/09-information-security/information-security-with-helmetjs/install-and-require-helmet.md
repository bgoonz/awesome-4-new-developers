# --description--

Working on these challenges will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

- Clone [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/) and complete these challenges locally.
- Use [our Replit starter project](https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec) to complete these challenges.
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the `Solution Link` field.

Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

# --instructions--

All your code for these lessons goes in the `myApp.js` file between the lines of code we have started you off with. Do not change or delete the code we have added for you.

Install Helmet version `3.21.3`, then require it. You can install a specific version of a package with `npm install --save-exact package@version`, or by adding it to your `package.json` directly.

# --hints--

`helmet` version `3.21.3` should be in `package.json`

```js
(getUserInput) =>
  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/package.json').then(
    (data) => {
      const packJson = JSON.parse(data);
      const helmet = packJson.dependencies.helmet;
      assert(helmet === '3.21.3' || helmet === '^3.21.3');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

  Backend challenges don't need solutions, 
  because they would need to be tested against a full working project.
