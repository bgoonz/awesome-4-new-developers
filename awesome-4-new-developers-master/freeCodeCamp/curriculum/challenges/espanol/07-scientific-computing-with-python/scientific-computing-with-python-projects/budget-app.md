# --description--

Create a "Category" class that can be used to create different budget categories.

You can access [the full project description and starter code on Replit](https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-budget-app).

After going to that link, fork the project. Once you complete the project based on the instructions in 'README.md', submit your project link below.

We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the Python curriculum. For now, here are some videos on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know to complete this project:

<ul>
  <li>

</ul>

# --hints--

It should create a Category class and pass all tests.

```js

```

# --solutions--

```js
/**
  Backend challenges don't need solutions,
  because they would need to be tested against a full working project.
  Please check our contributing guidelines to learn more.
