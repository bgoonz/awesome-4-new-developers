# --description--

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <https://yoyo44.herokuapp.com/>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, you can view all bars in my area.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can add myself to a bar to indicate you am going there tonight.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can remove myself from a bar if you no longer want to go there.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, when you login you should not have to search again.

**Hint:** Try using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3) to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the `Solution Link` field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the `GitHub Link` field.
