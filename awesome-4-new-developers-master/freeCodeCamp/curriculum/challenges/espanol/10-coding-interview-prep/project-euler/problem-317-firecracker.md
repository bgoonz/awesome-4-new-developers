# --description--

A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.

We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s2.

Find the volume (in m3) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.

# --hints--

`euler317()` should return 1856532.8455.

```js
assert.strictEqual(euler317(), 1856532.8455);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function euler317() {

  return true;
}

euler317();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
