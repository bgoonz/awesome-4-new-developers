# --description--

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project on [Replit](https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai), or cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-mochachai/).

`deepEqual()` asserts that two objects are deep equal.

# --instructions--

Within `tests/1_unit-tests.js` under the test labelled `#7` in the `Equality` suite, change each `assert` to either `assert.deepEqual` or `assert.notDeepEqual` to make the test pass (should evaluate to `true`). Do not alter the arguments passed to the asserts.

# --hints--

All tests should pass.

```js
(getUserInput) =>
  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/get-tests?type=unit&n=6').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.equal(data.state, 'passed');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

You should choose the correct method for the first assertion - `deepEqual` vs. `notDeepEqual`.

```js
(getUserInput) =>
  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/get-tests?type=unit&n=6').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.equal(
        data.assertions[0].method,
        'deepEqual',
        'The order of the keys does not matter'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

You should choose the correct method for the second assertion - `deepEqual` vs. `notDeepEqual`.

```js
(getUserInput) =>
  $.get(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/get-tests?type=unit&n=6').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.equal(
        data.assertions[1].method,
        'notDeepEqual',
        'The position of elements within an array does matter'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
