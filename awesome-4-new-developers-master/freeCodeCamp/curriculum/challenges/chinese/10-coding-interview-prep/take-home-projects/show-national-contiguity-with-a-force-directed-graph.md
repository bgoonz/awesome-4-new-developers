# --description--

**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/xVopBo>.

Fulfill the following [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.

**User Story:** I can see each country's flag on its node.

**Hint:** Here's a dataset you can use to build this: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json>

**Hint:** You can create a spritesheet of national flags at <https://www.flag-sprites.com>.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
