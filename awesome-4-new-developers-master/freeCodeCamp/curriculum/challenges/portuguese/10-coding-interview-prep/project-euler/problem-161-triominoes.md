# --description--

A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges.

There are two basic forms:

If all possible orientations are taken into account there are six:

Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with triominoes. If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be tiled with triominoes:

In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?

# --hints--

`euler161()` should return 20574308184277972.

```js
assert.strictEqual(euler161(), 20574308184277972);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function euler161() {

  return true;
}

euler161();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
