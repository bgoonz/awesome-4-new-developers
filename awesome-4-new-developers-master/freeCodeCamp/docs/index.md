## Curriculum

Our curriculum is curated by the global freeCodeCamp community. This way, we are able to incorporate expert knowledge from volunteers like you.

You can help expand and improve the curriculum. You can also update project user stories to better-explain concepts. And you can improve our automated tests so that we can more accurately test people's code.

**If you're interested in improving our curriculum, here's [how to contribute to the curriculum](how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md).**

## Translations

We are localizing freeCodeCamp.org to major world languages. Some of the certifications are already live in [Chinese (中文)](https://chinese.freecodecamp.org/learn) and [Spanish (Español)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/espanol/learn/). We encourage you to read the [announcement here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/world-language-translation-effort) and share it your friends to get them excited about this.

## Learning Platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools, and libraries. These include Node.js, MongoDB, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly, we use

- a Node.js based API server
- a set of React-based client applications
- and testing scripts to evaluate camper-submitted curriculum projects.

If you want to productively contribute to the learning platform, we recommend some familiarity with these tools.
