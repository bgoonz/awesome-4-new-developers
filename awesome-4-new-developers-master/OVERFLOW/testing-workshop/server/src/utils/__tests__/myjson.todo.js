// 1. import the createJSON function from ../myjson
// 2. import the axiosMock from axios
// 3. (optionally) create an inline mock for axios
// 4. create an async test that calls createJSON with whatever you want
// 5. Make assertions that the axios.__mock.instance.post was called with what it should have been

//////// Elaboration & Feedback /////////
// When you've finished with the exercises:
// 1. Copy the URL below into your browser and fill out the form
// 2. remove the `.skip` from the test below
// 3. Change submitted from `false` to `true`
// 4. And you're all done!
