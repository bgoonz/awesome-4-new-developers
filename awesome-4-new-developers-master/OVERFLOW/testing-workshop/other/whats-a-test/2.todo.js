// writing an assertion library
/*

Now let's implement our own assertion library.
Create a function called `expect` that accepts an "actual"
and returns an object of assertions.

Tip: I want to be able to use it like so:

> expect(actual).toBe(expected)

Then run this code with `node 2.todo`

> Make sure you're in the right directory!

const {sum, subtract} = require('./math')

let result, expected

result = sum(3, 7)
expected = 10
if (result !== expected) {
  throw new Error(`${result} is not equal to ${expected}`)
}

result = subtract(7, 3)
expected = 4
if (result !== expected) {
  throw new Error(`${result} is not equal to ${expected}`)
}
