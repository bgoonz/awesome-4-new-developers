Don't hesitate to ask questions; every contributor started with a first PR. You could be our thousandth!

Even if you're an experienced open source contributor, there are things that might trip you up. Once you've submitted your PR, Travis-CI will run a linter, often finding little issues with spacing or alphabetization. If you get a green button, everything is ready for review, but if not, click on the travis link to find out what the linter didn't like. Fix the problem and add a commit to your PR.

Finally, if you're not sure that the resource you want to add is appropriate for Free-Programming-Books, read through the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
