**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/BpwMZv/>.

Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.

**User Story:** I can start and stop the board.

**User Story:** I can set up the board.

**User Story:** I can clear the board.

**User Story:** When I press start, the game will play out.

**User Story:** Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.

**Hint:** Here's an explanation of Conway's Game of Life from John Conway himself: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8kUJL04ELA>

**Hint:** Here's an overview of Conway's Game of Life with rules for your reference: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>
