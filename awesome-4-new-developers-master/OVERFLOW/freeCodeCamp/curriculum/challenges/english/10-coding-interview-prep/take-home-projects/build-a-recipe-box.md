# --description--

**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/dNVazZ/>.

Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.

**User Story:** I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.

**User Story:** I can click into any of those recipes to view it.

**User Story:** I can edit these recipes.

**User Story:** I can delete these recipes.

**User Story:** All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

**Hint:** You should prefix your local storage keys on CodePen, i.e. `_username_recipes`

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
