# --description--

The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: $6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2$.

There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that $1 = 0^2 + 1^2$ has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Find the sum of all the numbers less than $10^8$ that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.

# --hints--

`palindromicSums()` should return `2906969179`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(palindromicSums(), 2906969179);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function palindromicSums() {

  return true;
}

palindromicSums();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
