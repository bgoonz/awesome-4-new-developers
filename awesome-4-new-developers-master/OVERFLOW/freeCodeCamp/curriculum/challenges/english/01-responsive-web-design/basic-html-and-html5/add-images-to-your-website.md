# --description--

You can add images to your website by using the `img` element, and point to a specific image's URL using the `src` attribute.

An example of this would be:

```html
<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg">
```

Note that `img` elements are self-closing.

All `img` elements **must** have an `alt` attribute. The text inside an `alt` attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

**Note:** If the image is purely decorative, using an empty `alt` attribute is a best practice.

Ideally the `alt` attribute should not contain special characters unless needed.

Let's add an `alt` attribute to our `img` example above:

```html
<img src="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/your-image.jpg" alt="A business cat wearing a necktie.">
```

# --instructions--

Let's try to add an image to our website:

Within the existing `main` element, insert an `img` element before the existing `p` elements.

Now set the `src` attribute so that it points to the url `https://www.bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat`

Finally, don't forget to give your `img` element an `alt` attribute with applicable text.

# --hints--

Your page should have an image element.

```js
assert($('img').length);
```

Your image should have a `src` attribute that points to the kitten image.

```js
assert(/^https:\/\/(www\.)?bit\.ly\/fcc-relaxing-cat$/i.test($('img').attr('src')));
```

Your image element's `alt` attribute should not be empty.

```js
assert(
  $('img').attr('alt') &&
    $('img').attr('alt').length &&
    /<img\S*alt=(['"])(?!\1|>)\S+\1\S*\/?>/.test(
      __helpers.removeWhiteSpace(code)
    )
);
```
