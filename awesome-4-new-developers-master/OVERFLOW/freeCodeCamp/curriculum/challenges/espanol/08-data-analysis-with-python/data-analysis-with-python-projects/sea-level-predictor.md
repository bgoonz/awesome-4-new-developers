# --description--

In this project, you will analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.

You can access [the full project description and starter code on Replit](https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-sea-level-predictor).

After going to that link, fork the project. Once you complete the project based on the instructions in 'README.md', submit your project link below.

We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the data analysis with Python curriculum. For now, you will have to use other resources to learn how to pass this challenge.

# --hints--

It should pass all Python tests.

```js

```

# --solutions--

```py
  # Python challenges don't need solutions,
  # because they would need to be tested against a full working project.
  # Please check our contributing guidelines to learn more.
