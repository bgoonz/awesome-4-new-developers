# --description--

Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.

Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways. For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways: 22852 + 203 22232 + 663 18102 + 1253 11972 + 1563

Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.

# --hints--

`euler348()` should return 1004195061.

```js
assert.strictEqual(euler348(), 1004195061);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function euler348() {

  return true;
}

euler348();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
