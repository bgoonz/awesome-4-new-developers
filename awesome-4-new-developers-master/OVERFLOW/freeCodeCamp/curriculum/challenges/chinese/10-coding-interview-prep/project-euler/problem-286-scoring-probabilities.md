# --description--

Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance x is exactly (1 - x/q), where q is a real constant greater than 50.

During each practice run, she takes shots from distances x = 1, x = 2, ..., x = 50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.

Find q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

# --hints--

`euler286()` should return 52.6494571953.

```js
assert.strictEqual(euler286(), 52.6494571953);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function euler286() {

  return true;
}

euler286();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
