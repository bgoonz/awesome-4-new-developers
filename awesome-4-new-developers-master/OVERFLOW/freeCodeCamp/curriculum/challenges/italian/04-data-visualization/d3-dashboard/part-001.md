Welcome to the dashboard project! You will be using the JavaScript data visualization library, D3, to build a visualization of your social media followers. It will consist of a line graph, a pie chart, and a legend.

First, you need to create the HTML file. Start by adding the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top of the file to tell the browser what type of document it's reading.
