# --description--

**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/>.

Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

**User Story:** I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.

**User Story:** if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

**Hint:** The relevant documentation about Twitch.tv's JSON API is here: <https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-streams>.

**Hint:** Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: `["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]`

**UPDATE:** Due to a change in conditions on API usage, Twitch.tv requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use <https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/> instead of Twitch's API base URL (i.e. `https://api.twitch.tv/helix` ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
