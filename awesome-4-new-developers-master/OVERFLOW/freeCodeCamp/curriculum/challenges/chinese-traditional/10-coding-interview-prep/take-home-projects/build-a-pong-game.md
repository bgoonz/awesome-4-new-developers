**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/satyamdev/full/pdMmBp>.

**Rule #1:** Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2:** Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can control a paddle.

**User Story:** The computer can control the other paddle.

**User Story:** The computer's paddle is unbeatable. It should never miss the ball.

**User Story:** The game keeps track of the player and computer's score.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
