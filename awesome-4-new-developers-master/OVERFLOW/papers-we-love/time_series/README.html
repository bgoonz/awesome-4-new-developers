<p>Important papers relating to time-series data</p>
<p>Time-series data presents specific but very common problems for efficient analysis, resulting in the need for columnar data stores and iterative one-pass processing.</p>
<p>The included documents are:</p>

Zumbach and Ulrich A. Müller</p>
<p>We present a toolbox to compute and extract information from inhomogeneous (i.e. unequally spaced) time series. The toolbox contains a large set of operators, mapping from the space of inhomogeneous time series to itself.</p>
<p>These operators are computationally efficient (time and memory-wise) and suitable for stochastic processes. This makes them attractive for processing high-frequency data in finance and other fields. Using a basic set of operators, we easily construct more powerful combined operators which cover a wide set of typical applications.</p></li>

<p>Time Series smoothing method to better prioritize attention in time series exploration and monitoring visualizations, smooth the time series as much as possible to remove noise while still retaining large-scale structure. We develop a new technique for automatically smoothing streaming time series that adaptively optimizes this trade-off between noise reduction (i.e., variance) and outlier retention (i.e., kurtosis).</p></li>
