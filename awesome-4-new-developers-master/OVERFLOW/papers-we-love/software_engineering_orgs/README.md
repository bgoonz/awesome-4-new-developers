# Software Engineering Organizations 

The [practice of software engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering), and [its history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_software_engineering) is, itself, a complex study in [humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet), [coordination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process), and communication.

## Software Engineering 

* [Studying Attitudes and Social Norms in Agile Software Development (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09225.pdf) by Lucas Gren
    > This paper reviews research on attitudes and social norms and connect it to the agile software development context. Author proposes additional theories from social psychology that would most certainly be useful for further sense-making of human factors-related research on agile teams.

* [Happiness and the productivity of software engineers (2019)](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1904/1904.08239.pdf) by Daniel Graziotin & Fabian Fagerholm
    > This paper provides an overview of studies on the happiness of software developers. You will learn why it is important to make software developers happy, how happy they really are, what makes them unhappy, and what is expected for their productivity while developing software.

* [Why Software Projects need Heroes (Lessons Learned from 1100+ Projects) (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09954.pdf) by Suvodeep Majumder, Joymallya Chakraborty, Amritanshu Agrawal & Tim Menzies
    > This paper explores the effect of having heroes in projects, from a code quality perspective. Authors identify the hero developers of 1100+ open source GitHub projects. Based on the analysis, they find the majority of all projects are *"hero" projects* and commits from *hero developers* (who contribute the most code) result in far fewer bugs than other developers -- which is contrary to the literature.

## Organizational Simulation

* [:scroll:](common-ground-and-coordination-in-joint-activity.pdf) [Common Ground and Coordination in Joint Activity](http://jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/Common_Ground_Single.pdf) by Klein, Feltovich, and Woods

  > The paper is the result of what happens when people with backgrounds in mathematics, psychology, and artificial intelligence (Feltovich and Bradshaw) get together to ask questions about how teams operate alongside the originators of modern decision-making and cognitive systems engineering research (Klein and Woods). The concepts outlined in the paper have provided frames and directions in designing tools and environments where successful work requires multiple actors (whether they are people or software agents!) to succeed. This seminal paper takes a deep dive into not just people and teamwork, but what comprises the sometimes invisible activity of coordination, collaboration, cooperation, and the contracts and expectations entities have with each other along the way. The paper has had far-reaching influence in multiple domains: military intelligence, space transportation and aviation, and more recently: software engineering and operations on the web. Let me walk you through where this paper came from, what makes this paper critical to the future of software, and a hint about what I'm sure it means about the future. - @allspaw
