As a first step in this direction, we develop a formal notion of expressiveness and investigate its properties. To demonstrate the theory's closeness to published intuitions on expressiveness, we analyze the expressive power of several extensions of functional languages. Based on these results, we believe that our system correctly captures many of the informal ideas on expressiveness, and that it constitutes a good basis for further research in this direction.
