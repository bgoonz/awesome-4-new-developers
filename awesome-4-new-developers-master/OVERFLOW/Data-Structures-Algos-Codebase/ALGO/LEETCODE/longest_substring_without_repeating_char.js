/* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:

Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring. */

/*
For each iteration from i = 0 to i < s.length do the follwoing steps

A> From the given string keep pushing the chars to a "newSubStr", till there's no repeating char. Note that this newSubStr is the string, that we will be calculating the length for. And for each loop of i from 0 to s.length

B> When a char has already occurred previously (i.e. if (index !== -1 ) is true, then first I have to reset the "newSubStr" to start taking the characters from the next index and going upto the newSubStr.length because I can-not take a substring that has a repeating character. (And note that the newSubStr has been built only upto the current index value of i)

And then push this char at this index position to the resetted-newSubStr value.

C> And after all the above, at each iteration of the loop, we are reassigning the maxLen to be the max of maxLen till now and subArr.length. And by the end of all the iterations I am returning the final max.

// SOLUTION-1
const lengthOfLongestSubstring = (s) => {
  let newSubStr = [],
    maxLen = 0,
    index;

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    index = newSubStr.indexOf(s[i]);

    if (index !== -1) {
      newSubStr = newSubStr.slice(index + 1); //Note, for slice() If endIndex is omitted, slice() extracts to the end of the string, when I want to extract / slice till the end of the string, I dont need to pass the second argument.
    }

    newSubStr.push(s[i]);

    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, newSubStr.length);
  }

  return maxLen;
};

// console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb"));   // => 3
// console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb"));   // => 1
// console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew"));   // => 3

// SOLUTION-2 - The same exact logic, only difference is, I am not using a separate variable index here. In the above I am first checking if this item is duplication (if duplicate then fist slice) and only then I am pushing to the newSubStr the char. But here, I am combining both these steps in below.

lengthOfLongestSubstring_2 = (s) => {
  let max = 0,
    newSubStr = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    // If 'i' is duplicated newSubStr.indexOf(i) will return the current index of that i and I will start slicing from the next position. And if its not duplicated, I will staring slicing from 0-index position and all the way upto the last char of newSubStr.

    newSubStr = newSubStr.slice(newSubStr.indexOf(s[i]) + 1);
    max = Math.max(newSubStr.push(s[i]), max); // remember the push() returns the new length of the array after pushing
  }
  return max;
};

console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring_2("abcabcbb")); // => 3
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring_2("bbbbb")); // => 1
console.log(lengthOfLongestSubstring_2("pwwkew")); // => 3
