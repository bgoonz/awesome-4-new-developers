Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than 1.

**Example:**

Given the sorted array: \[-10,-3,0,5,9\],

One possible answer is: \[0,-3,9,-10,null,5\], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \\

-3 9
/ /
-10 5
