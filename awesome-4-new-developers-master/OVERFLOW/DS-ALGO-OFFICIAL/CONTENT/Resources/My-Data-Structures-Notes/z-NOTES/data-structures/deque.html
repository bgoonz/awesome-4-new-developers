    <p>
      Deque is used as an abstract data type, also referenced as a double-ended
      queue. Similar to a queue, deques exist as an ordered collection of items.
      A deque’s nature is unrestrictive, meaning that it easily allows for
      adding and removing items at either end. Deques are a unique hybrid linear
      structure that provide the capabilities of stacks and queues in a unique
      data structure. Deques can be implemented with a dynamic array or with a
      doubly-linked list and they do not require Last In First Out (LIFO) or
      First In First Out (FIFO)orderings that are required by both stacks and
      queues. The homophone “dequeue” is used as a verb, meaning to remove from
      a queue.
    </p>
    <p>Examples that use Deque:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A nice application of the deque is storing a web browser’s history.
        Recently visited URLs are added to the front of the deque, and the URL
        at the back of the deque is removed after some specified number of
        insertions at the front.
      </li>
      <li>
        Another common application of the deque is storing a software
        application’s list of undo operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        One example where a deque can be used is the A-Steal job scheduling
        algorithm. This algorithm implements task scheduling for several
        processors. A separate deque with threads to be executed is maintained
        for each processor.

      Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There may be an implementation that is very simple, but untenable for
        larger deques.

    <p>
      Discuss as a group how a deque differs from other data structures already
      reviewed. Some suggested questions to consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are the methods a deque must have?</li>
      <li>What can be tracked in a deque?</li>
      <li>When would a deque be used?</li>
      <li>What other data structures are used to make a deque?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="independent-practice">Independent Practice</h3>
    <p>
      Implement a deque in JavaScript, keeping in mind all methods and helper
      methods that define a deque. Consider performance – what happens as you
      call specific methods you’ve defined?
    </p>
    <h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
    <p>
      There are many different ways to implement a deque in any language.
      Implement a deque a different way from what you did before, then consider
      how it differs. Is this second implementation better? If you get stuck,
      check out StackOverflow comments!
    </p>
    <h3 id="check-for-understanding">Check for Understanding</h3>
    <p>Find another person in the cohort and discuss:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What are some of the of the advantages/ disadvantages of using deques?
      </li>
      <li>
        In a language of your choice, can you implement some of the basic
        operations a deque must perform?
      </li>
      <li>
        Having implemented queues and stacks, can you identify situations where
        deques are a better data structure to use?
      </li>
    </ul>
