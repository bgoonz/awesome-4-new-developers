  /*
  Problem Statement:
  Given a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places, where k is non-negative.

  Note:
  * While Solving the problem in given link below, don't use main() function.
  * Just use only the code inside main() function.
  * The purpose of using main() function here is to aviod global variables.
