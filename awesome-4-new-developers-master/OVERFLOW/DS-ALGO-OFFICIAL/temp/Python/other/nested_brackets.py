"""
The nested brackets problem is a problem that determines if a sequence of
brackets are properly nested.  A sequence of brackets s is considered properly nested
if any of the following conditions are true:

        - s is empty
        - s has the form (U) or [U] or {U} where U is a properly nested string
        - s has the form VW where V and W are properly nested strings

For example, the string "()()[()]" is properly nested but "[(()]" is not.

The function called is_balanced takes as input a string S which is a sequence of
brackets and returns true if S is nested and false otherwise.
