The 5-digit number, 16807=75, is also a fifth power. Similarly, the 9-digit number,
134217728=89, is a ninth power.
How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an nth power?

The maximum base can be 9 because all n-digit numbers < 10^n.
Now 9**23 has 22 digits so the maximum power can be 22.
Using these conclusions, we will calculate the result.
