"""
This Bellman-Ford Code is for determination whether we can get
shortest path from given graph or not for single-source shortest-paths problem.
In other words, if given graph has any negative-weight cycle that is reachable
from the source, then it will give answer False for "no solution exits".
For argument graph, it should be a dictionary type
such as
graph = {
    'a': {'b': 6, 'e': 7},
    'b': {'c': 5, 'd': -4, 'e': 8},
    'c': {'b': -2},
    'd': {'a': 2, 'c': 7},
    'e': {'b': -3}
}
