To find minimum cost path 
from station 0 to station N-1,
where cost of moving from ith station to jth station is given as:

Matrix of size (N x N)
where Matrix[i][j] denotes the cost of moving from
station i --> station j   for i < j

NOTE that values where Matrix[i][j] and i > j does not 
mean anything, and hence represented by -1 or INF

For the input below (cost matrix), 
Minimum cost is obtained as from  { 0 --> 1 --> 3} 
                                  = cost[0][1] + cost[1][3] = 65
the Output will be:

The Minimum cost to reach station 4 is 65

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(n)
