"""The K factor of a string is defined as the number of times 'abba' appears as a substring.
Given two numbers N and k,â€‹ find the number of strings of length N with 'K factor' = k.

The algorithms is as follows:

dp[n][k] will be a 4 element array, wherein each element can be the number of strings of length n and 'K factor' = k which belong to the criteria represented by that index:

    dp[n][k][0] can be the number of strings of length n and K-factor = k which end with substring 'a'
    dp[n][k][1] can be the number of strings of length n and K-factor = k which end with substring 'ab'
    dp[n][k][2] can be the number of strings of length n and K-factor = k which end with substring 'abb'
    dp[n][k][3] can be the number of strings of length n and K-factor = k which end with anything other than the above substrings (anything other than 'a' 'ab' 'abb')

Example inputs

n=4 k=1  no of strings = 1
n=7 k=1 no of strings = 70302
n=10 k=2 no of strings = 74357
