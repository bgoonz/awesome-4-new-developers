""" 
Python implementation of the Interpolation Search algorithm.
Given a sorted array in increasing order, interpolation search calculates
the starting point of its search according to the search key.

FORMULA: start_pos = low + [ (x - arr[low])*(high - low) / (arr[high] - arr[low]) ]

Doc: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation_search

Time Complexity: O(log2(log2 n)) for average cases, O(n) for the worst case.
The algorithm performs best with uniformly distributed arrays.
