"""
A Krishnamurthy number is a number whose sum total of the factorials of each digit is equal to the number itself.

Here's what I mean by that:

"145" is a Krishnamurthy Number because,
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

"40585" is also a Krishnamurthy Number.
4! + 0! + 5! + 8! + 5! = 40585

"357" or "25965" is NOT a Krishnamurthy Number
3! + 5! + 7! = 6 + 120 + 5040 != 357

The following function will check if a number is a Krishnamurthy Number or not and return a boolean value.
