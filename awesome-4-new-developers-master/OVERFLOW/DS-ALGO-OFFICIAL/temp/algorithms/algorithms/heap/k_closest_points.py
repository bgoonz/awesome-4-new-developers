"""Given a list of points, find the k closest to the origin.

Idea: Maintain a max heap of k elements.
We can iterate through all points.
If a point p has a smaller distance to the origin than the top element of a heap, we add point p to the heap and remove the top element.
After iterating through all points, our heap contains the k closest points to the origin.
