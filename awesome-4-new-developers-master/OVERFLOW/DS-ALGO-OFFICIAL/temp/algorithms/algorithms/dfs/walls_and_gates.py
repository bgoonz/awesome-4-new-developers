"""
You are given a m x n 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:
    -1: A wall or an obstacle.
    0: A gate.
    INF: Infinity means an empty room. We use the value 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 to represent INF 
         as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than 2147483647.
Fill the empty room with distance to its nearest gate.
If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

For example, given the 2D grid:
    INF -1  0   INF
    INF INF INF -1
    INF -1  INF -1
    0   -1  INF INF
After running your function, the 2D grid should be:
    3   -1  0   1
    2   2   1   -1
    1   -1  2   -1
    0   -1  3   4
