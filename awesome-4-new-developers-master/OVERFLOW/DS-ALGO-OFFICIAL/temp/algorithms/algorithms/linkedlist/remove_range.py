"""
Given a linked list, remove_range function accepts a starting and ending index
as parameters and removes the elements at those indexes (inclusive) from the list

For example:
List: [8, 13, 17, 4, 9, 12, 98, 41, 7, 23, 0, 92]
remove_range(list, 3, 8);
List becomes: [8, 13, 17, 23, 0, 92]

legal range of the list (0 < start index < end index < size of list).
