"""
Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less
than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x.  If x is contained
within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x.
The partition element x can appear anywhere in the "right partition";
it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.

3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition=5]
3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

We assume the values of all linked list nodes are int and that x in an int.
