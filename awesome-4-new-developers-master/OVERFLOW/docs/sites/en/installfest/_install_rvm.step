message <<-MARKDOWN
RVM stands for Ruby Version Manager and is the easiest way to install and manage Ruby.  The [official RVM install instructions](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) are available here, but this should work for you:
MARKDOWN

step "Install RVM" do
  console "curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable"
  message "This will download and install RVM."

  important do
    message <<-EOT
      You might see an error like "**GPG signature verification failed**"

      If so, run the suggested command to add RVM's GPG keys:

      `gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3`"

      (the command may start with `gpg` or `gpg2` -- use whichever was provided in the RVM error message)

      Afterward, try installing RVM again:

      `curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable`
    EOT
  end
end

step "Configure your shell" do

  message "Every time you open a new terminal window, rvm will be active inside it. Close your terminal window and open a new one."

  verify do
    console "type rvm | head -1"
    result "rvm is a function"

    console "rvm -v"

  end
