Delays the execution of an asynchronous function.

- Delay executing part of an `async` function, by putting it to sleep, returning a `new Promise()`.

```js
const sleep = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
```

```js
async function sleepyWork() {
  console.log("I'm going to sleep for 1 second.");
  await sleep(1000);
  console.log("I woke up after 1 second.");
}
```
