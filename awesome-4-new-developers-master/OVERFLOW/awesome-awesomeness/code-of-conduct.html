      Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
    </h1>
    <h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>
    <p>
      In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
      contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project
      and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
      age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
      level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
      sexual identity and orientation.
    </p>
    <h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>
    <p>
      Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
      include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
      <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
      <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
      <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
      <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
        or advances
      </li>
      <li>
        Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
        attacks
      </li>
      <li>Public or private harassment</li>
      <li>
        Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic
        address, without explicit permission
      </li>
      <li>
        Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
        professional setting
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>
      Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
      acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
      corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
      reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
      contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
      temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
      deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
    </p>
    <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
      spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
      Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
      project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or
      acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
      Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by
      project maintainers.
    </p>
    <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
      Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
      reported by contacting the project team at a.bayandin@gmail.com or
      soy@miguelpiedrafita.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
      and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to
      the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
      confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
      details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
      good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by
      other members of the project’s leadership.
