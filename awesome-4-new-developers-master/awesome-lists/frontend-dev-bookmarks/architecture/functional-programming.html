      Functional programming is a programming paradigm, that treats computation
      as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and
      mutable data.

            Clojure (but of interest to other languages) that emphasizes

            and ‘filtering’ and their concrete reuse across all of the contexts
            above. +
