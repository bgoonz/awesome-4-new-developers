        >Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Computer Science</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Our curricular guidelines are from the 2013 report of the Association for
      Computing Machinery and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
      Engineers. This report is the most recent in a series of such reports
      outlining the expectations of undergraduate degrees in Computer Science.
      The report outlines critical Knowledge Areas and topics within them. It
      drills down further to outline specific learning goals, going so far as to
      outline what concepts a student must be able to explain vs concepts a
      student must be able to demonstrate using in practice.

      The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a
      professional association formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the
      American Institute of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of Radio
      Engineers. As of 2018, it is the world’s largest association of technical
      professionals with more than 423,000 members in over 160 countries around
      the world. Its objectives are the educational and technical advancement of
      electrical and electronic engineering, telecommunications, computer
      engineering and allied disciplines.
