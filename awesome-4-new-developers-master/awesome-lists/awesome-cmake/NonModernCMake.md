# Non-Modern (but still awesome) CMake [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

> This is an archive of pre-modern [CMake](https://cmake.org/) scripts, modules, examples and others

Your contributions are highly welcome (first see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

This file contains links worth taking a look, but they use obsolete practices which are considered non-modern - like not using `target_*`-based dependency management - see [`#16`](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake/issues/16) and [`#42`](https://github.com/onqtam/awesome-cmake/pull/42) for more details.
