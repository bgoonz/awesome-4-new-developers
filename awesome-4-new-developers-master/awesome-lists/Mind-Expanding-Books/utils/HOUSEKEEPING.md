This contains documentation on `housekeep.py` which was a command developed for converting from legacy README
format to the new format. This is not used anymore.

## Getting started

### Setup

1. Copy `config-sample.py` to `config.py`

```bash
  cp config-sample.py config.py
```

2. Get a GoodReads API key [here](https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys)
3. Copy your public key to the `config.py` file

### Converting

Run

```bash
  python3 housekeep.py --file_type='old'
```

The `--file_type='old'` flag is needed if the books are displayed in the old format (in a list). New format is the default (when the records are displayed in tables).

This will convert to the new format and save it to `README-new.md`.

**Note!** the first conversion can take some time, we wait 1 second between each request to GoodReads to not abuse the API.
After the first generation only missing records will be tried to be retrieved.

Run to see the available arguments

```bash
  python3 housekeep.py --help
```
