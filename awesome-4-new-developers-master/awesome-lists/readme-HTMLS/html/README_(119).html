    <p>Resources to help independent developers make money.</p>
    <p>
      Making money from your own code has never been easier, but it’s still
      hard. Here, I try to curate a list of resources to help everyone
      interested in making money from their digital products get inspired and
      give it a try. Be it monetizing side-projects, bootstrapping business
      ideas, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Projects don’t need to be big, actually, it’s better if they are not, they
      just need to be profitable. They might provide a passive income after the
      initial bulk of work, and who knows, maybe even help you reach financial
      independence.
    </p>
    <p>Going indie does have lots of lifestyle perks :)</p>
    <p>
      All these resources might help inspire you and put you on the right track
      but in the end what matters is to <strong>MAKE and TRY stuff</strong>. So
      devour this content responsibly :)
    </p>
    <p>Contributions are more than welcome.</p>

          Learn from profitable businesses and side projects. IndieHackers is
          probably the catalyst for this new wave of interest on making an
          independent income. It is a collection of interviews to successful
          developers about their products. IndieHackers has been especially
          interesting to follow since it’s been an indie project itself.
          <a href="https://twitter.com/csallen?lang=ca">Courtland Allen</a> has
          been very transparent about
          <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/blog">how he built it</a>. The
          last news make one think that the forum/community will grow.

          there’s a waitlist. Cost is $249 for lifetime access. I’m not a member
          so I can’t personally endorse it. Generally, I’m skeptic on products
          targeting indie makers but I still found it relevant to add this
          specific product because of cross references. Some people might find
          it interesting. Feel free to reference to reviews!

          Probably one of the most known indie hackers of the last couple of
          years talks about how to turn our side-projects into profitable
          businesses. Very straight to the point, Pieter always provides a lot
          of insightful thoughts. By the way, don’t get fooled by his lifestyle,
          his success is 500% work.

          Lightning 7-minute talk by one of the most respected indie developers.
          The point Patrick is trying to make, is that solo developers can
          target way smaller and niche markets which might have low competition
          and be very profitable from a solo business point of view.

          The challenge that started it all for Pieter. It inspired me to do
          something similar. What matters is to create and ship a lot, learning
          in the process, until something is worth pushing further.

          This is just an example of a business more than one would be happy

          Storemapper, I think he always maximizes for valuable content.
