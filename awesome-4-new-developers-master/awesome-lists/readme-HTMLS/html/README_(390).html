      # Awesome Testing

        ><img
          src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg"

      &gt; A curated list of testing software, extensions and resources
    </p>
    <h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
    <p>
      This is intended to be a curation of resources for the new among the
      software testing community. It is not tailored to a specific area
      (Usability/Performance) or role (Automation/Management). The idea is that
      you could hand this list to a CS graduate and it would greatly improve
      their testing skills, efficiency and overall breadth of knowledge. Note
      that this is for all areas of software testing after the code in question
      is written (no unit tests/static analysis!).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I’m sure everyone who reads this list has one thing they want to
      add. Please read the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/TheJambo/awesome-testing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"
        >How to Contribute</a

      page and add to the list. :)
