    Sydney Harris (Journalist for the Chicago Daily News and, later, the Chicago
    Sun-Times) | | “There are two ways of constructing a software design: One
    way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and
    the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
    deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.” |
