        real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a daemon process
        that logs to an output file. It is written to be as lightweight and
        flexible as possible, so that it can be easily adaptable to different

        your own system, capable to emulate complex infrastructures to convince
        an adversary that he just found a huge industrial complex. To improve
        the deceptive capabilities, we also provided the possibility to server a
        custom human machine interface to increase the honeypots attack surface.
        The response times of the services can be artificially delayed to mimic
        the behaviour of a system under constant load. Because we are providing
        complete stacks of the protocols, Conpot can be accessed with productive
        HMI’s or extended with real hardware. Conpot is developed under the
        umbrella of the Honeynet Project and on the shoulders of a couple of
        very big giants.

        low-interaction Honeypot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://glastopf.org/">Glastopf</a> - Glastopf is a Honeypot
        which emulates thousands of vulnerabilities to gather data from attacks
        targeting web applications. The principle behind it is very simple:
        Reply the correct response to the attacker exploiting the web
        application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/desaster/kippo">Kippo</a> - Kippo is a
        medium interaction SSH honeypot designed to log brute force attacks and,
        most importantly, the entire shell interaction performed by the
        attacker.

      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/tnich/honssh">HonSSH</a> - HonSSH is a

        and a honey pot, creating two separate SSH connections between them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/bifrozt/">Bifrozt</a> - Bifrozt
        is a NAT device with a DHCP server that is usually deployed with one NIC
        connected directly to the Internet and one NIC connected to the internal
        network. What differentiates Bifrozt from other standard NAT devices is
        its ability to work as a transparent SSHv2 proxy between an attacker and
        your honeypot. If you deployed an SSH server on Bifrozt’s internal
        network it would log all the interaction to a TTY file in plain text
        that could be viewed later and capture a copy of any files that were
        downloaded. You would not have to install any additional software,
        compile any kernel modules or use a specific version or type of
        operating system on the internal SSH server for this to work. It will
        limit outbound traffic to a set number of ports and will start to drop
        outbound packets on these ports when certain limits are exceeded.

        - T-Pot is based on the network installer of Ubuntu Server 16/17.x LTS.
        The honeypot daemons as well as other support components being used have
        been containerized using docker. This allows us to run multiple honeypot
        daemons on the same network interface while maintaining a small
        footprint and constrain each honeypot within its own environment.

        - This script will install T-Pot 16.04/17.10 on a fresh Ubuntu 16.04.x
        LTS (64bit). It is intended to be used on hosted servers, where an
        Ubuntu base image is given and there is no ability to install custom ISO
        images. Successfully tested on vanilla Ubuntu 16.04.3 in VMware.
