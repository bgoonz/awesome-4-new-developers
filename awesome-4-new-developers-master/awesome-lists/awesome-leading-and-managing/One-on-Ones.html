          — by Brent Baisley. Takeaway: Three questions to help with
          alignment/purpose are: 1) What are you working on? (description of the
          work to be done); 2) Why are you working on it? (purpose behind the
          work); 3) How is it going to have an impact?

          - by Leah Candelaria-Tyler. Takeaway: “In conducting one-on-ones, the
          goal is to move beyond your role as a manager, and be an available ear
          for your teammate. In a room, with the door closed and pen in hand,
          you are all ears and eyes while sitting across from your teammate,
          ready to discuss and resolve performance concerns, and just generally
          talk about work. Not only are you setting goals in these meetings, you
          are also tracking their progress in achieving these goals; making you
          their biggest fan!”

          >
          — by KnowYourCompany CEO Claire Lew. Takeaway: Make empathy your
          mission. Every 1:1 should have a single mission, “to understand how

          energy.

          manager, the managee) to share relevant information from the previous
          manager to the new manager about the direct report…“do this
          transparently such that the direct report can get a good sense of
          whether there’s things unsaid or things that differ from their own
          perception, with an opportunity to disagree or clarify, and reduce the
          natural career friction, pausing, or hiccups that happen when a person
          gets a new manager.”

          <a href="http://www.bhorowitz.com/one_on_one">One on One</a> - by Ben
          Horowitz. Takeaway: “Perhaps the CEO’s most important operational
          responsibility is designing and implementing the communication
          architecture for her company. The architecture might include the
          organizational design, meetings, processes, email, yammer and even
          one-on-one meetings with managers and employees. Absent a
          well-designed communication architecture, information and ideas will
          stagnate and your company will degenerate into a bad place to work.
          While it is quite possible to design a great communication
          architecture without one-on-one meetings, in most cases one-on-ones
          provide an excellent mechanism for information and ideas to flow up
          the organization and should be part of your design.”

          create goals like “build trusting relationships between team leads and
          engineers,” “[create] a safe place to discuss sensitive and private
          issues or provide personal feedback, and”discuss and work on career
          development plans So engineers can set goals for themselves and have a
          partner who helps them achieve these goals." Sticking to these goals
          will make the meetings more productive.

          - by Trish Tormey. Takeaway: “The 1-1 is the best way for managers and
          those who report to them to connect on pressing issues, develop a
          strong relationship, and ensure that employees feel like they’re
          working toward their goals – at work, and otherwise. Without a proper
          framework, agenda, and mindset, however, the 1-1 meeting can become
          just another meeting in your day.”
