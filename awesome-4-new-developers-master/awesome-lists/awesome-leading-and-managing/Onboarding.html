            Failed Projects</a
          >
          - by Spydergrrl. Takeaway: “[T]he teams I’ve been on with the
          strongest culture were those where a concerted effort was made not
          only to bring new members up to speed with the work, but with the
          ideas that underlie the work. Without saying so much, we infused them
          with the mission and vision of the project by spending the time to
          help them understand why we were doing what we were doing. Making sure
          that we weren’t just explaining what they would be doing, but why and
          for whom.”

          - by FirstRound. Takeaway: Lots of advice on setting up new employees
          to grow throughout their stay with your company, from emphasis on
          beign original in your onboarding practice to making new employees
          approachable.

          >
          - by Bizzabo. Takeaway: No deployments to production on your first
          day, but instead identify tools to make an impact. Most onboarding
          tasks are done solo, but “distracting” team members is okay. Also: All
          software/devstack setup is manual, so that people will know how to fix
          it when it breaks; and new hires are encouraged to give constructive
          feedback about the product.

          “rotation” through multiple teams, and how this enables them and the
          org to find the best fit and increase empathy.

          (video) - a full onboarding curriculum by Kate Heddleston, from
          RailsConf 2014. Takeaway: Onboarding is taking someone from outside
          the team and making them productive (technical knowledge);
          independent/autonomous (company/process knowledge); reliably
          independent; and confident/believe they are valuable (personal
          development).

          - by David Nimmo. Takeaway: before moving on to the next coding
          problem, take the time to save hassle for the next person joining your
          team or working with your code.

            Onboarding.</a
          >
          - by Toast. Takeaway: “Ultimately, Toast’s engineering onboarding
          playbook is comprised of a mixture of background information
          transmitted through automated systems, coupled with direct in-person
          trainings. Team leads and onboarding buddies help fill in the gaps to
          get each and every person acclimated to life at Toast and ready to do
          their best work. The entire process is systematized and documented, so
          that everyone knows what to expect, and labor is divided between
          automated systems and people on the team, so that no one person is
          overburdened and nothing slips through the cracks.”

            >Treat Your Onboarding Process Like Your Build System</a
          >
          - by Don Neufeld. Takeaway: “Onboarding must be: Repeatable; Self
          Service; Written Down; In Source Control. Additionally, I believe the
          key to keep your onboarding documentation alive, accurate, and up to
          date is this: Every New Hire Must Update The Docs.”
