          >
          - by Scott Belsky. Takeaway: “organizational debt is the accumulation
          of changes that leaders should have made but didn’t.” Consistently
          optimize how you work.

            “Siloed”</a
          >
          - by Marla Gottschalk. Takeaway: Signs include a lack of a
          constructive cross-functional conversation; customers are no longer
          central to the conversation; you are unsure what other functions are
          really doing; there’s rampant “blame-storming” and separate cultural
          identities; things are portrayed as a “zero sum” game; and you’ve
          given up trying to become a better organization.

            >Buffer Sees Clear Benefits to Transparent Employee Salary Policy</a
          >
          - by Bryan Behrenshausen. Takeaway: “At social media startup Buffer, a
          single leadership decision eliminated salary negotiation for new
          employees, preempted gender-based salary discrimination, and prompted
          a flood of job applications. The decision? Make all employee salaries
          transparent.”

            >Changing Company Culture Requires a Movement, Not a Mandate</a
          >
          - by Bryan Walker and Sarah A. Soule. Takeaway: “[C]ulture change
          can’t be achieved through top-down mandate. It lives in the collective
          hearts and habits of people and their shared perception of ‘how things
          are done around here.’ Someone with authority can demand compliance,
          but they can’t dictate optimism, trust, conviction, or creativity.”
          This also applies to the best-intentioned culture changes, including
          agile transformations. You might have the best intentions in the
          world, but if your team doesn’t see the value or direction of the
          change, don’t expect them to adapt.

          >
          - by Ranganathan Balashanmugam. Takeaway: “Collaboration becomes
          difficult with organizational growth. So, hierarchy may not be easily
          eliminated as the organization grows but can be implemented well — by
          respecting diversity and better ways of adopting and implementing
          authority and decision making. Choose a model that is not coming in
          the way of collaboration and works in the context of the
          organization.”

            >Company Culture Is Shaped at the Top, and Forms at the Bottom</a
          >
          - by Lorenzo Pasqualis. Takeaway: “A company culture is an overall
          personality that results from the interactions between its people, and
          the environment in which employees work. It includes elements such as
          mission, values, environment, ethics, expectations, mood, goals,
          politics, morals, rules and policies.”

            >The Company Isn’t a Family</a
          >
          - by David Heinemeier Hansson. Takeaway: “Whenever executives talk
          about how their company is really like a big ol’ family, beware.
          They’re usually not referring to how the company is going to protect
          you no matter what or love you unconditionally. You know, like healthy
          families would. The motive is rather more likely to be a
          unidirectional form of sacrifice: Yours.”

            >Creating Psychological Safety: Start with Trust</a
          >
          by Alyss Noland. Takeaway: Psychological safety is a combination of
          trust between coworkers and an environment where that trust can be
          acted upon. Start with building those bridges between peers, providing
          managerial support, and creating a strategic narrative that uplifts
          every team’s accomplishments.

          >
          - by Tomas Laboutka. Takeaway: “Without full alignment and team
          empowerment, a company will not be able to make good decisions and
          execute quickly. Some studies point out that for every 1 hour of work
          done by product teams, 48 minutes is spent waiting for a decision to
          be made. That means in one 8-hour day, 3.5 hours is dedicated to
          waiting. This is crazy.”

            >Culture Is the Behavior You Reward and Punish</a
          >
          - by Jocelyn Goldfein. Takeaway: Employees will work to emulate other
          successful employees. Success is what happens <em>publicly</em>. If
          successful people in a company all behave similarly, then alignment
          and culture flow from that.

          place.

            >Culture Is the Spec, Process Is the Code</a
          >
          - by Rich Armstrong. Takeway: Create every process around your
          culture. Just like your devs need specs in order to know what code to
          write, your company needs processes in order to implement culture.

            Culture</a
          >
          - by Katie Denis. Takeaway: “Every email sent by a vacationing
          employee is a tiny cultural erosion: a signal to other employees that
          time off isn’t really time off. In aggregate, these tiny erosions
          matter. They send signals like ‘I don’t trust you to do the job
          without me,’ or ‘I’m not organized enough to wrap up my loose ends
          before I go on vacation.’ Either way, they erode perceptions of your
          likability and competence.”

          - by Sujith Nair. Takeaway: “Culture cannot be enforced, but only
          facilitated. Hiring is crucial in building and sustaining great
          engineering culture. Continuous learning helps create the right
          engineering team environment. Self-driven teams with minimum
          directions are ideal teams that we all should aspire for. An
          environment without red-tape and unnecessary controls will help
          engineering innovation, productivity &amp; quality.”

          working on a specific project, not just focusing on how they’re
          involved and what the project is about, can help you foster better
          relationships across your organization. Focusing on why people act the
          way they do allows teams to better understand one another’s goals and
          purposes, and helps everyone assume the best intentions from everyone
          involved in an effort.”

          happens when no formal culture is put into place. It leaves people
          guessing what is socially acceptable and creates an impossible
          environment for those who guess wrong. It’s not the type of

          evolve in growing organizations. “Generally speaking, and certainly if
          a company is working well to some degree— if you’re making progress in
          building the product you want to build and the service you want to
          create, and if the organization is growing and customers are
          adopting—there are empirically some things about your culture that are
          working well. And I often see companies making a mistake by being too
          abashed about simply being specific about those.”

          - by Mitch Pronschinske. Takeaway: Common themes across these seven
          engineering cultures include removing everything that hinders
          productivity; having as few rules as possible; hiring adults; having
          smaller teams and shorter projects; being kind and modest; not
          focusing on blaming, and focusing on learning from mistakes. Dan
          Pink’s autonomy, mastery, and purpose are also common themes.
          Diversity is also important for some of these companies because, as
          research shows, diverse teams are more effective than homogeneous
          ones.

          decent, and to build an organization that values decency, builds up.
          Like technical debt, it comes more from ignorance and expediency than
          malice. Some leaders are sociopaths, no doubt, but I think most would
          insist that they aren’t trying to make things awful. They just never
          bothered to give enough of a shit to make them better.”

            >Nails in the Coffin: Why a Flat Organizational Structure Fails</a
          >
          - by Lighthouse. Takeaway: GitHub, Zappos, Medium and others have
          abandoned flat hierarchies because you can’t manage everyone yourself;
          they slow things down; unspoken lines of communication and decision
          making form; you miss or become overwhelmed by problems; you waste
          time re-inventing the wheel; important decisions can become a mess.
          Instead of flat hierarchy, develop your leaders instead.

          - by Katherine Daniels. Takeaway: “It can be a challenge if you’re
          starting with or coming from a ‘blame and train’ or ‘blame and shame’
          culture to a ‘blameless’ or ‘blame-aware’ one, but the focus on
          desired outcome and how people can work together to help resolve a
          situation in the moment, as well as make the systems involved better
          equipped to handle situations in the future, can do wonders for system
          and organizational resilience.”

          - by Jason Warner. Takeaway: “Leaders are accountable for the culture
          of their group. Said another way, the cultural brokenness of a group
          can in almost all cases be traced directly to poor leadership, either
          past or current.”

          - by Allison Parrish. Takeaway: “Every practice, whether technical or

          >
          - by John Cutler. Takeaway: “We can intellectualize psych safety as
          much as we want…but a lot of this boils down to having the guts to be
          present, not be an ass, chill out, consider the needs of those around
          you, and give people room to do good work.”

          It’s not a fact of life—you end up with suboptimal solutions by it.
          Embracing an Architecture First approach and technical analogs will
          help you drive better organizational solutions by removing emotion
          from the equation. Selfless leadership—company, team, then self, in
          that order—is the essential ingredient in all of this for driving the
          best solutions.

          (video) - by Jon Terry, of LeanKit. Takeaway: What “respect for
          people” means is open to interpretation. Reading a lot of books and
          articles isn’t a quick-fix to understanding it. Understanding that
          people are motivated by purpose and staying in touch with continuous
          improvement helps to reinforce respect for people.

          - by Alice Goldfuss. Takeaway: “[D]rinking tea has made my job much
          easier. People give it to me, offer to drink it with me, use it as an
          icebreaker. It’s both a gateway to interesting conversations and a
          reward for doing favors. I now participate in a social experience that

          - by Jim Whitehurst, CEO of RedHat. Takeaway: “Leading an open
          organization—where hierarchy cedes much of its control to dynamic,
          networked structures—feels much more like maintaining a perennial
          garden. It involves working more on conditions (turning soil, locating
          those spots in need of watering) than it does on dictating direction.
          It means creating the context for things (things you might not have
          considered or even imagined) to occur.”

          - by Rand. Takeaway: “Your company’s culture is three big things: Your
          values – those you state with words and those you exhibit through your
          actions[;] your mission &amp; vision – the goal you’re driving toward
          and the force behind that goal[;] your hiring, firing, and promotion
          criteria – the reasons you bring people onto the team, the reasons you
          let them go, and the reasons you promote/reward them[.] If you’re
          trying to figure out what a company’s values really are, look at the
          decisions management makes when lots of money, risk, or loss of face
          for executives is at odds with the stated values.”

          and capacities that enable someone to interact effectively with other
          people. Whereas hard skills are job-specific knowledge, soft skills
          are transferable and involve: The ability to communicate honestly and
          openly; To listen and engage; To have empathy with and concern for
          others; To be able to work in a highly diverse environment.”

          “Even small acts that seem inconsequential at the time can pave the

        not only a pipeline or recruiting issue. It’s an issue of making the
        people who do make it through the pipeline want to stay at your
        company.” Write a code of conduct no matter the size of your company, to
        create norms that ideally make your workplace safe.
