  2. **Purpose:** There are always technical challenges to be found in organizations, but you’re probably not building a company with a bunch of insanely hard tech problems. This means you have to work harder to sell the learning opportunities. Let engineers into the non-technical decision-making processes.
  3. **Respect:** Respect that engineers are smart individuals who often have more to add to your business than just their coding talents. Teach them to respect that the other parts of the business have equally valuable skills and perspectives. Engineers don’t need to feel like the company royalty to be inspired to do good work, but they do need the opportunity to be treated like a partner.

Takeaway: "People don’t leave jobs, they leave managers." A study of 7,200 people showed that half had left a job because of their manager. Employees want daily face time from their manager, and regular meetings.

  1. **Business Motivated:** Driven most by a desire to get things done for the customer; have a can-do attitude. In terms of code, they think more concretely, and aren't always the best at creating abstractions that support reuse or other non-functional goals. They just want to get things done and see a functional product.
  2. **Technology Motivated:** Love learning new things for its own sake; eager to find the newest framework, language, or methodology and will take every opportunity to try it out on their current project. Know all the trending technologies, and have probably dabbled with them over nights and weekends. On a greenfield project they thrive, but when the field turns "brown" and new code turns into legacy, they look for greener pastures, or—possibly worse—seek ways to shoehorn in technology even if it's to the detriment of the system.
  3. **Problem Motivated:** Hard problems excite these developers, independent of which technology is employed or even if it adds value for the business. It's all about the puzzle. Coming up with an elegant, clever, or quality solution is the victory. While their solutions are solid, sometimes the details slip.
