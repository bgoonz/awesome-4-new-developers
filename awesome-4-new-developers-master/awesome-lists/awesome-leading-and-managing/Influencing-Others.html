          >
          - by Jen Bunk. Takeaway: Commmunication trainings, and communication
          skills, aren’t enough to fix cultural issues. You need to go deeper

          different reasons why you might not be getting across, with guidance
          on determining which problems are important; how to get organizational
          support; bringing solutions instead of problems; timing, and what to
          do if despite your efforts change still doesn’t come.

          - by Julie Zhuo. Takeaway: Tips for communicating more succinctly in
          emails to reduce workload and also increase the chances that others
          will read them. Also includes this nugget: “Forwarding a huge thread
          with nothing more than ‘Thoughts?’ at the start is the e-mail
          equivalent of a flaming bag of dog poop on your doorstep.”

          >
          - by John Cutler. Takeaway: “It is unfair to expect people who haven’t
          worked on the front lines in software development to just get it. Just
          as, I’m guessing, it is hard for developers and UXers to grok sales
          and marketing, being a CEO, and working in HR. Assuming malice is a
          big mistake. We all want great outcomes for our respective businesses,
          but have a hard time bridging the divide.”

          - by Vishal Kapur. Takeaway: “Some aspects of the impact generation
          process are in your control, and some aren’t. The world
          (i.e. the”environment“) isn’t in your control. Neither are the
          outcomes you get from trying things – remember the intention/impact
          gap. However, generating ideas, making things, taking risks, and the
          people you choose to work with are.”

          - by Darius Foroux. Takeaway: Identify, interpret, manage your
          emotions. “When you can identify your own emotions, you will also get
          better at identifying other people’s emotions.” This can positively
          impact your leadership abilities.

          >
          - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: Model what you’d like to be true of your

          instead of individual/personal; give space, grace, and gratitude to
          leaders.

            >How To Lead When You Have No Authority</a
          >
          - by Matt Russell. Takeaway: “Leadership is a choice you make rather
          than a place you sit. In other words, leadership comes from influence
          and not from your position. For this reason, even when you’re not in
          front, you’re still leading those around you.”

          >
          - by Edmond Lau. Takeaway: Gather input as to what’s hard or
          frustrating; explicitly design how to align someone’s growth goals
          with what creates value; give and request frequent and honest
          feedback; leverage your strengths to level up the team; reduce sources
          of complexity, and create more opportunities for collaboration.

            >The Indispensable Document for the Modern Manager</a
          >
          - by First Round. Takeaway: “To grow the company and as a leader,
          every manager at a startup needs to scale herself. At the end of the
          day, writing a user guide is an exercise in self-awareness. What teams
          want from their leaders more than anything else is predictability and
          authenticity. This leads to trust. With trust, you can be unstoppable.
          Give yourself a leg up and take the time to self-reflect, write and
          revise a user guide. If your founding team and early hires are friends
          or past colleagues — this is especially critical.”

          >
          - by Jeff Weiner. Takeaway: “We all need to be wary of avoiding the
          Ron Burgundy syndrome: On the surface, looking and sounding the part,
          but without providing the right discipline, focus, and ongoing
          context, appearing as nothing more than a talking head.” Includes
          lessons for communicating more effectively.

          >
          - by Johnathan Nightingale. Takeaway: “If you want to be a leader, own
          it. Like you would anywhere else in your life. Work harder to
          understand the context. Develop better strategies for anticipating
          future failure and avoiding it. The stuff you expect junior folks to
          do.”

          team standups, giving a presentation to a client, or pitching your
          promotion to your boss - and yet we all have different fears about
          those moments. In this talk, we’ll walk through the spectrum of public
          speaking fears and learn tactics to address them, so you can feel
          confident and equipped to step into the spotlight.”

          - by FirstRound. Takeaway: “To persuade someone, you need to speak as
          much as you can to System I [of the brain]— the child, the interns —
          who want to believe you (because it just makes so much darn sense,
          what’s not to love?). Trouble is, most tech operators express
          themselves with complexity, nuance, facts and figures. That’s their
          default, and it doesn’t appeal to people’s unconscious processor.”

          >
          - by First Round. Takeaway: “Communication is not just about what you
          say, it’s about the reaction it causes in the listener. Often we think
          delivering a message is enough without checking to see if it was
          actually received. This can be made more efficient with attention to
          meta models. Lastly, communication is making sure there’s enough
          shared context for the person to act on what’s next.”

          - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: The question is, “How can I help you?” This
          is lazy, puts pressure on the employee, and is vague. Instead,
          “[p]oint out your own potential flaw, instead of waiting for your
          employee to point it out. Offer a critique of your own actions,
          instead waiting to see if it’s something your employee brings up.”

          - by Gary Ford. Takeaway: Influence is the power to affect
          someone/something without directly forcing them. It’s about
          establishing credibility, finding common ground, and connecting
          emotionally. A systemic approach to influencing.

            >Use Coaching Techniques to Help People Make Their Own Decisions</a
          >
          (video) - by Meredith Noble. Takeaway: A talk about how to use the
          GROW coaching technique “to structure conversations and help people
          make their own decisions; ask questions that encourage people to
          consider new approaches; embrace the coaching mindset, and and let go
          of the urge to play expert.”

          - by FirstRound Capital. Takeaway: “The first step is to identify what
          type of complexity you are attempting to unravel…Let’s call them:
          complexity as gathering, complexity as dusting and complexity as
          pattern-matching (or pattern-resisting)…[then P]inpoint where on a
          1-10 scale the recipient of your explanation falls.”

          by Tom Critchlow. Takeaway: “[I]n this theatre of human work it’s
          crucial to speak up. Spending time on the performance is not wasted -
          in fact quite the opposite. Without performance work gets sidelined,
          ignored or worse[.]”
