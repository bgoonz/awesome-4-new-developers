          - by Blameless. Takeaway: Suggests turning your post-mortems into
          “textbook-lets,” being cautious about finding good authors, and
          creating action items with structured discipline.

            >The Infinite Hows (or, the Dangers of The Five Whys)</a
          >
          - by John Allspaw. Takeaway: A slight tweak to the “5 whys.” Allspaw
          points out that “why” leads to blaming a person, while “how” leads to
          blaming the system.

            >The Root Cause Fallacy</a
          >
          - by Baron Schwartz. Takeaway: Asking why repeatedly will always get
          you to the CEO, eventually; stop looking for a single root cause —
          instead, identify system of conditions/dysfunctions that jointly
          caused the problem; change the culture and own failures as
          opportunities.

            >Social Issues in Postmortems</a
          >
          - by John Allspaw. Takeaway: “Although apparently technically focused,
          postmortems are inherently social events. Especially for events with
          significant consequences, there are incentives to direct attention
          towards some issues and away from others. When large losses incur
          attention of senior management the tenor and content of the postmortem
          may shift away from freewheeling discourse to a more closed ended,
          narrowly technical discussion. Postmortems may become “stage plays”
          intended to assert organizational control, ratify management
          decisions, or localize and truncate the inquiry into circumstances and
          contributors."

          >
          - by Adam Vaccaro. Takeaway: Imagine the disruption that causes your
          company’s demise. Have pre-mortems: “Meet before a project and imagine
          they’re a few months or a year in the future and that the project has
          failed.” Or the opposite: “the team imagines absolute success–and
          talks through the crucial hypothetical points in the process where the
          right decisions were made.”

          to your advantage. “[E]mbracing failure can be one of the best things
          you do for your project. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By
          learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward.
          Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and wasted
          potential.”

          - by Dana Pylayeva at Gilt/HBC Digital. Takeaway: Pylayeva describes
          how she and other facilitators organized a meaningful retrospective
          involving 60 people and five consulting companies. Lots of details,
          references to other resources and insights into what went well and
          what didn’t.

            Time Zones</a
          >
          - by Luke Hohmann. Takeaway: “[T]raditional approaches to
          retrospectives – assembling a group people in a room with one or more
          facilitators – are too costly, don’t scale, take far too long and fail
          to produce high-impact results. As a consequence, large organizations
          either skip retrospectives entirely or they relegate retrospectives to
          individual teams, which tragically limit their effectiveness in
          identifying and implementing enterprise changes that can profoundly
          improve performance. Over time, because individual teams are not
          obtaining material benefits from retrospectives, they stop doing them
          at all.” Using online games can be a less expensive option.

          - by Henrik Kniberg. Takeaway: How decentralized retrospectives with
          tiered granularity helped Spotify hold large and meaningful retros.
          Breaking down large groups into teams organized around themes is the
          “scaling trick” here.

          practice of looking back to move forward.” Includes the Retrospective
          Prime Directive: “Regardless of what we discover, we understand and
          truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what
          they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources
          available, and the situation at hand.”
