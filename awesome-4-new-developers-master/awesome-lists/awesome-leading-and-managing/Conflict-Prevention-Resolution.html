          - by Retrospective.co/Anonymous. Takeaway: “Brilliant jerks harm team
          morale and productivity. They don’t have to worry about being nice,
          because they are the top dog, and people need their natural talent.
          They have no incentive to try to improve, because they can simply go
          somewhere else. If you look carefully, you’ll notice that they often
          bounce around from place to place. They know they can get away with
          it.” You must apply a “no jerks” policy.

          - by Brendan Gregg. Takeaway: Identifies selfless (cares about the
          company) and selfish (cares primarily about themselves) brilliant
          jerks. “Companies can adopt a ‘no asshole rule,’ or more politely, a
          ‘no brilliant jerks’ policy. Colleagues may be genuinely conflicted
          about how to deal with [the selfish type of "brilliant jerk"]: on the
          one hand, he is a real jerk, but on the other he is a ‘high
          performer,’ so isn’t it in the company’s best interest to tolerate his
          behavior? A policy helps you decide, and it can be as simple as three
          words: no brilliant jerks.”

          - by Yonatan Zunger. Takeaway: “One very reliable pattern I’ve
          observed in a lot of situations is that the strength of people’s
          emotional response to a statement tells you a lot about how close this
          statement cuts to their biggest worries. It’s sort of obvious if you
          say it that way, but if you apply it as a detection method, it’s very
          powerful: strong responses lead you to where the real problems are,
          the real threats to people.”

          - by McKinsey. Takeaway: “[D]e-energizing relationships—those that are
          negative or draining—have a 4 to 7 times stronger negative impact on
          performance than the positive effects of relationships that are
          energizing (defined as leaving employees feeling enthused or upbeat).”

          - by Douglas R. Conant. Takeaway: Conant avoids expectation
          mismanagement based upon hoped-for mind reading and confusion by
          spending one hour “declaring himself” in a conversation. He covers
          what is important to him, what kind of leader he’s trying to become,
          what he values in an organization, what he seeks in direct reports,
          how he believes the industry operates, his planning philosophy, his
          operating style, his background, and his favorite quotes.

          calculate the opportunity cost.

          >
          - by Scott Belsky. Takeaway: “A common mistake I observe in leaders of
          teams big and small is to aspire for peace as a default. You should be
          challenging peace as a default. Create an environment where people can
          withstand a fight and engage in friction as it arises. Rather than
          passively surf the whims of peoples’ hesitations to take action, bring
          the conflict to the surface[.]”

            >Learning to Embrace Conflict as a Part of Startup Culture</a
          >
          - by Eric Paley. Takeaway: “Ego makes conflict painful because we try
          to avoid hurting others’ feelings, while protecting our own. But for
          many, winning the argument becomes more important than the company
          making the right decision. Therefore, when we engage conflict, we
          become emotional and want to win for ourselves, confusing this emotion
          with our desire to win collectively. While each of us struggles with
          this tension, the problem is exacerbated by the fact that everyone in
          the debate naturally is subjective on the superior value of their
          perspective. This tendency can often lead to anger, insecurity, and
          unnecessary emotion that makes conflict painful, relationship
          threatening and unproductive. Unfortunately, ego frightens many team
          members to shift into conflict avoidance.”

          - by First Round. Takeaway: “a behavior often isn’t good or bad in and
          of itself — it’s the application of that behavior to a given context
          that’s good or bad…Research shows that, in about 70% of cases,
          difficult people will be shocked about how their behavior is being
          received and will simply self-correct. They didn’t know, and just
          stop.” Includes eight archetypes: Narcissus, Bean Counter, Venus

          intelligence and living in the moment — which ultimately contributes

          belief; opt for in-person communication if possible, because it’s
          easier for people to dehumanize you via text communication; and use
          video conferencing instead of email.

            >Overcome the 5 Dysfunctions of a Team</a
          >
          : by The Mission. Takeaway: 1. It takes time to build trust in a team.
          2. Never fear conflict, as “the only purpose of productive conflict is
          to produce the best solution in the shortest period of time.” 3.
          Commitment is a function of two things: clarity and buy-in. Great
          teams move forward with complete buy-in, including members who voted
          against the decision. Therefore, leaders must be comfortable with the
          prospect of making a decision that turns out to be wrong. 4. Leaders
          must create a culture of accountability in/to the team by encouraging
          and allowing the team to serve as the first and primary accountability
          mechanism. 5. Leaders must set the tone for the team to focus on
          results. If the team members sense that the leader values anything
          other than results, they will take that as permission to do the same.

          - by Brenda Barbosa. Takeaway: Taking some cues from psychologist and
          couples researcher John Gottman, avoid conflict by lightening up;
          showing empathy; calming yourself down; and showing appreciation for
          the other person.

          >
          - by FirstRound. Takeaway: “Essentially, the amount you trust someone
          is the sum of how credible you believe they are on a subject, how
          reliable they’ve proven themselves to be over time, and how authentic
          you think they are as a person, divided by how much you think they’re
          acting in their own self interest. Looking at her colleagues’
          relationship through this lens, [article subject Anne Raimondi, who’s
          been a Director of Product at eBay, VP Marketing at SurveyMonkey, CRO
          at TaskRabbit, SVP Operations at Zendesk, and COO at Earnin] helped
          them diagnose when and how trust had eroded, and eventually work with
          them to heal the rift.”

          >
          - by Amy Gallo. Takeaway: “[M]ost people don’t want to disagree or
          know how to do it. In fact, we’ve come to equate saying “I see it
          differently” or “I don’t agree” with being angry, rude, or unkind, so
          it makes most people horribly uncomfortable…Disagreements are an
          inevitable, normal, and healthy part of relating to other people.
          There is no such thing as a conflict-free work environment. You might
          dream of working in a peaceful utopia, but it wouldn’t be good for
          your company, your work, or you. In fact, disagreements — when managed
          well — have lots of positive outcomes."
