## When You're Not a "Manager": Leadership for Developers

### Software Craftspersonship and Teamwork

- [Active Learner — How Developers Keep Learning](https://medium.com/dennis-nerush/active-learner-how-developers-keep-learning-1309b91f1ae6) - by Dennis Nerush. Takeaway: "the kind of developers we want to hire and be part of our company and our teams ... are not expert beginners and they are not necessary real experts. But they are aware of what they know and most importantly, what they don’t know. They are on the path to someday become real experts. To go in this path they cannot rely only on what their job teaches them and 'out of the box' just working solutions—they must actively learn."

- [Are You out of Alignment?](https://medium.com/@skamille/are-you-out-of-alignment-a7b193ab7fc4) - by Camille Fournier. Takeaway: "Getting into alignment with the company is often a challenge for senior ICs because it requires a major change in focus. The hardest part is now identifying the right problem to solve, instead of solving the hardest problem. If you want to be able to find interesting work and also work on important things, you generally have to go find the interesting important things yourself. This requires that you to talk to a lot of people and listen to their problems, and then place a bet on a solution to one of these problems that will actually both be feasible but will also be seen as important."

- [Can Metrics Be Used to Take Back Control of Your Software Delivery?](https://leaddev.com/scaling-software-systems/primer-engineering-delivery-metrics) - by Juan Pablo Buriticá. Takeaway: A straightforward, thorough post on different types of engineering metrics that teams can apply to measure their effectiveness meaningfully. Highlights Dr. Nicole Forsgren’s _Accelerate_ as an influence, and also questions velocity as a meaningful metric in that it can be easily gamed. “The primary lesson I took from deploying delivery metrics was the importance of trust. For metrics to be successful, I needed my team to trust my intentions and embrace the strategy presented to them, especially when I didn’t have too many answers on the actual results we’d get.“

- [Cognitive Biases in Programming](https://medium.com/@evidanary/cognitive-biases-in-programming-5e937707c27b) - by Yash Ranadive. Takeaway: Be mindful of hyperbolic discounting (going for an immediate payoff instead of a delayed larger one), the IKEA Effect (Overvaluing your own solutions to a problem, and thus in contrast undervalue other solutions), premature optimization (optimizing before you know that you need to), planning fallacy (optimistically underestimating the time required to complete a task), and recency bias (placing higher value on recent events than ones that occurred further in the past).

- [First Thoughts on Developer Gravity](http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2017/07/28/first-thoughts-on-developer-gravity/) - by James Governor. Takeaway: A post that's a kickoff to future exploration, but already offers insights about "developer gravitiy" (where devs "live") and the importance of developer experience (which decreases with poor documentation, bug fixes and examples). "Developers are certainly not immune to the perception of momentum for environments they might target. Tensor Flow, for example, is seen as a hot technology. GitHub makes developer momentum more obvious than ever. 25k forks – sign me up! Developers want to adopt technologies than other developers find interesting. Herd mentality is a thing."

- [Forget Velocity, Let's Talk Acceleration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbcyyu8XB_Y) (video) - by Jessica Kerr. Takeaway: a Goto Copenhagen talk about acceleration: deliberate changes in speed and direction to do the most valuable work.

- [Giving and Receiving Great Code Reviews](https://dev.to/samjarman/giving-and-receiving-great-code-reviews) - by Sam Jarman. Takeaway: "[A]s a submitter, plan, tell the story, and use the review as a learning experience. As a reviewer, slow down, check carefully, automate as much as you can and take the opportunity to improve your team."

- [Habits vs Goals: a Look at the Benefits of a Systematic Approach to Life](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2017/06/habits-vs-goals/) - by Farnham Street. Practical advice about focusing on forming habits—which promote continuous improvement—instead of achieving goals, which have an endpoint.

- [Health Score Metrics as a Software Craftsmanship Enabler](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2017/10/health-score-metrics-as-a-software-craftsmanship-enabler) - by Chong Wang. Takeaway: About LinkedIn's health score platform that "collects and presents craftsmanship-elevating metrics, and provides a framework for convenient extension."

- [How Do I Convince...?](https://codurance.com/2017/06/13/how-do-I-convince/) - by Sandro Mancuso of Codurance. Takeaway: "One of the biggest mistakes we make as developers is to think that adopting certain practices is a goal that all teams and organisations should have. Technical practices and methodologies are a means to an end and not a goal on their own. They are the 'how,' not the 'why.' Before pushing a practice or methodology to a team or organisation, we should make sure that everyone understands the problem we are trying to solve - the 'why.' ... Don’t discuss practices. Discuss the value you would like to provide and walk backwards."

- [How Do You Know Your Code Is Bad?](https://dev.to/bob/how-do-you-know-your-code-is-bad) - by Dinesh Babu. Takeaway: "When you write code, ask yourselves these questions: Is this code too rigid? Is it possible to change the internals of this module in the future without touching the code in other modules and other layers? Is this code too fragile? Will it be hard to find all the places to refactor for any changes in the future? Should this feature be reusable? If so, does this code depends on any unwanted modules or frameworks that can be avoided?"
- [How to Level up as a Developer w/Scott Hanselman](https://dev.to/niko/how-to-level-up-as-a-developer-w-scott-hanselman) - by Niko. Takeaway: Fear and potential keep us from reaching our full potential. Learn how differentiate between doing the right things and doing things right.

- [Notes to Myself on Software Engineering](https://medium.com/s/story/notes-to-myself-on-software-engineering-c890f16f4e4d) - by François Chollet. Takeaway: Lists of points on the development process, API design, and software careers. "Productivity boils down to high-velocity decision-making and a bias for action. This requires a) good intuition, which comes from experience, so as to make generally correct decisions given partial information, b) a keen awareness of when to move more carefully and wait for more information, because the cost of an incorrect decision would be greater than cost of the delay. The optimal velocity/quality decision-making tradeoff can vary greatly in different environments."

- [On Writing Tech Specs](https://codeburst.io/on-writing-tech-specs-6404c9791159) - by Chuck Groom. Takeaway: "A tech spec forces you to think through complicated issues and to get everyone on the same page. This helps to avoid wasting time on dead-end solutions or building the wrong thing."

- [Post-Commit Reviews](https://copyconstruct.medium.com/post-commit-reviews-b4cc2163ac7a) - by Cindy Sridharan. Takeaway: “An alternative to pre-commit reviews is post-commit reviews, which lets a developer merge changes to trunk, and address reviewer comments in follow-up pull requests. In many ways, post-commit reviews offer the best of both worlds: developer velocity is not sacrificed at the altar of waiting for an approval, and reasonable concerns get addressed in short order by the developer in follow-up commits.” Includes guidance on how to overcome challenges.

- [Software Entropy Explained: Causes, Effects, and Remedies](https://www.toptal.com/software/software-entropy-explained) - by Adam Wasserman. Takeaway: "The primary goal is to create an awareness of software entropy because it is a factor in all forms of software development. Furthermore, we explore a means by which software entropy can be assigned a concrete value. Only by quantifying software entropy and observing its growth over successive releases can we truly understand the risk it poses to our current objectives and future plans."

- [Speed in Software Development](https://www.targetprocess.com/articles/speed-in-software-development/) - by Michael Dubakov. Takeaway: "Software development pace / productivity / speed is a complex, interdependent and multifaceted concept. It has no easy solution. You can’t shout at people “work faster!” You can’t blindly cut corners and focus on value added activities only. The only solution is to think deeply about the company, development processes, people, tools, etc. Build a model and think."
