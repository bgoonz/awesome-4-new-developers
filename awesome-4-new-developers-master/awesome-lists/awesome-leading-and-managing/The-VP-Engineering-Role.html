            >The CTO to VP Engineering Fork</a
          >
          - by Julia Austin. Takeaway: “When you’ve decided it’s time to fork
          that technology leadership role and have both a CTO and a VPE, look
          for someone eager to create a partnership. Someone who prefers to lean
          into GSD and growing teams and who values the technology leadership,
          vision and evangelism of your CTO. Be leery of career CTOs who seek a
          role as VPE at your company — they may say they’re willing to be in
          charge of GSD, but could easily step on your CTOs toes.”

          >
          - by Bruno Miranda. Takeaway: VPEs are measured by the success of
          their team; set process in terms of “<em>why</em> we do what we do”;
          keep coding; manage up and down.

          >
          - by Dan DeMeyere. Takeaway: “VP’s of Engineering are essential to
          making sure the trains run on time and identifying the best way to lay
          down tracks. If the CTO knows the destination, the VPE is identifying
          the route to get there.”

          >
          - by Raffi Krikorian &amp; Dave Loftesness. Takeaway: a VP
          Engineering’s primary duties involve “establishing focus; leading and
          designing the engineering org; and representing engineering at the
          leadership level.”
