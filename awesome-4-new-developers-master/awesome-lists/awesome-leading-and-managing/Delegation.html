      Avoiding Micro- and Undermanagement
    </h3>
    <p>
      Micromanagement leads to mistrust, lack of autonomy, demotivation.
      Undermanagement leads to isolation, bewilderment, cluelessness. Just-right
      management (“Goldilocks”) leads to increase in engagement.

            >Applying the Universal Scalability Law to organisations</a
          >
          - by Adrian Colyer. Takeaways: “a) It’s really important you learn to
          delegate effectively and to choose carefully the things that you do
          get involved in. b) As the organisation grows, strive to keep the
          number of stakeholders that need to be involved in any decision down
          to a minimum. c) You need to keep a strict handle on how many things
          you’re involved in concurrently. d) Working at or close to 100%
          utilization will slow to a crawl everything that depends on you.”

          >
          - by Claire Lew. Takeaway: “When you delegate the outcomes and not the
          activities, you help employees not just execute for the task at hand,
          but equip them for every future task after that. You’re giving true
          ownership to your team.”

          >
          (video) - by Jürgen Appelo of M 3.0. Takeaway: a quick and clear video
          outlining seven levels of delegation: tell, sell, consult, agree,
          advise, inquire and delegate. “By distributing control and delegating
          decision making in an organization, we empower both workers and
          managers, enabling resilience and agility. This makes delegation truly
          an investment and an achievement.” This

            >How to “Get out of the Way”</a
          >
          - by Phil Sarin. Takeaways: Remove mechanisms of control: examples
          include estimation, meetings, sprints; increase focus (eliminate
          projects and reduce the number of priorities to 1-2); give authority
          to choose any approach that would lead to success. Need strong
          agreement on the goals of the project. If your managing principle is
          trust and not control, then people matter more than processes do.

          beyond what the assignment was—these are the leaders.

          - by MetaLab founder Andrew Wilkinson. Takeaway: “I now think of my
          companies as machines. I determine the result that I want, design a
          machine that will produce the result, then figure out what sort of
          people I need as part of it. If I’m part of the machine, I think about
          my strengths and weaknesses, and if necessary replace myself with
          someone better suited to the role.”

          >
          - by William Oncken, Jr. and Donald L. Wass. Takeaway: Think of each
          work item as a screaming monkey, and ask these questions to identify
          the important ones: Should we even fed the monkey?; Who should feed
          the monkey?

          ability, and aptitude; commitment describes motivation, interest,
          enthusiasm, and confidence; different levels of proficiency/commitment
          need different amounts of direction/support.

      - by Will Larson. Takeaway: “Succession planning is thinking through how
      the organization would function without you, documenting those gaps, and
      starting to fill them in. It’s awkward enough to talk about that it
      doesn’t get much discussion, but it’s a foundational skill for building an
      enduring organization.”

          >
          - by Margaret Gould Stewart. Takeaway: “If there isn’t something going
          off the rails on your team, then I know you’re micro-managing them.
          You’re good at what you do, and if you stay in the weeds on
          everything, you’ll keep things going perfectly, for a while. But
          eventually two things will happen. One, you’ll burn out. And two,
          you’ll eventually start to seriously piss off your team. So I better
          see some things going sideways, on a fairly regular basis.”

          >
          - by Steven Sinofsky. Takeaway: “[M]anagers should not ask people on
          the team to do yucky work that the manager doesn’t want to do. Or said
          another way, if there’s something yucky to be done then managers
          should join in. That’s all well and good, but is also just basic
          civility I think.”
