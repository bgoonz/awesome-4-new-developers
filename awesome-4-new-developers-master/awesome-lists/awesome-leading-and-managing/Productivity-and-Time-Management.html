          - by April Wensel. Takeaway: “The prevailing work culture in Silicon
          Valley is not sustainable. We all know it, but few are doing anything
          to change it…As leaders, whether in name or in spirit, you have a
          responsibility to cultivate a healthier, more sustainable culture.
          Why? Your team will be more productive. As shared in
          <em>The Optimistic Workplace</em>, ‘People in positive work
          environments outperform those who work in negative climates by
          10–30%.’ As an employee, you owe it to yourself to improve your own
          situation, whether that means inspiring change at your current company
          or moving on to somewhere that actually does value you as a human
          being.”

          Staying well rested is part of your job. Sleep and exercise help, but
          occasional extended breaks are essential too, and their benefits on

          - by Frank Kalman. Takeaway: Mostly geared toward an American
          audience, the article questions the trend toward bragging about having
          no time and filling one’s schedule—counterproductive given stress,
          health issues, burnout, and other negative side effects. “Yes, working
          hard is important. But at what point does it become unproductive to
          constantly seek to be the most productive?”

          >
          - by Barry O’Reilly. Takeaway: “Over-optimizing for executing work is
          dangerous. Actually, it’s very dangerous indeed as it causes us to get
          stuck in plan-do-plan-do cycles. We compromise reflection,
          retrospection, and review of the outcomes of all the output we are
          creating. We stop building learning loops into our work to
          plan-do-check-act the results of all this effort. We don’t allow time
          to study, consider, or understand if the result of all this activity
          is actually aligned to what we are hoping to achieve. We are frankly
          too busy to.”

            >Do You Manage Like a Gatekeeper or a Gardener?</a
          >
          - by Jared Williams. Takeaway: Directed for new tech leads, this
          article discusses how to be a gatekeeper—“[who] controls the flow of
          information in an attempt to narrow focus and avoid surprises”
          (otherwise known as a “shit shield”)—and a gardener who “trusts,
          encourages autonomy, and exposes their team to higher level problems.”

          >
          - by Brian. Takeaway: “[B]efore breaking ground on any project, write
          down the problem you’re trying to solve and why you’re solving it. Get
          that reviewed before you make any decisions or write any code. And
          make sure you do it every time before you start building a new piece
          of software. Do this, and you’ll avoid the many pitfalls that can keep
          an engineer from solving the right problem.” Why we solve the wrong
          problems: technology-driven development, premature frameworks, sunk
          cost roadmaps.

          >
          - by Oren Ellenbogen. Takeaway: “It’s your responsibility to handle
          incoming requests from humans, to say ‘no’ or at least ‘later’ when
          appropriate. Humans learn, they just need feedback.” Includes a
          template to send people when distractions/disruptions become
          unmanageable/affect productivity.

          >
          - by Joel Spolsky. Takeaway: “You gather evidence, mostly from
          historical timesheet data, that you feed back into your schedules.
          What you get is not just one ship date: you get a confidence
          distribution curve, showing the probability that you will ship on any
          given date…The steeper the curve, the more confident you are that the
          ship date is real.”

          - by Henrik Kniberg. Takeaway: Focus on extracting more value from
          your available time. “Busy-ness” is an artificial concept. Build slack
          into your schedule to achieve better focus.

          - by Joe Goldberg. Takeaway: “Todo List Zero: Stuff on your to-do list
          that needs more than a moment to resolve should get onto your
          calendar. Block out time in advance for [this], at the time of day
          where you get your best work done (figure this out if you don’t
          already know). Also block out time for self-initiated tasks: time to
          do nothing but think, time to learn and read, etc.”

          - by Jared Williams. Takeaway: “To manage, new leaders often adopt the
          role of a gatekeeper early on and have a hard time letting go…A
          gatekeeper controls the flow of information in an attempt to narrow
          focus and avoid surprises.” Be a gardener instead. “A gardener trusts,
          encourages autonomy, and exposes their team to higher level problems.
          Gardeners turn scaling and growth into a team sport.”

          peers), as well as how much time an individual level should generally
          be spending on them vs “work”. Make sure you are spending the right

          productive. Don’t overcommit. And check to see if this describes you:
          “…I found that I was most frequently canceling or re-scheduling on my
          strongest and most valuable connections because I believed they’d be
          most likely to understand.”

          >
          - by Christine Porath. Takeaway: “Rudeness and bad behavior have all
          grown over the last decades, particularly at work. For nearly 20 years
          [Porath has] been studying, consulting and collaborating with
          organizations around the world to learn more about the costs of this
          incivility. How we treat one another at work matters. Insensitive
          interactions have a way of whittling away at people’s health,
          performance and souls.”

          - by Derek Sivers. Takeaways: If you are overcommitted, recalibrate
          when you say yes. Saying “no” more gives you more time to say “HELL
          YEAH!” for things that are really important to you.

          - by Katherine Daniels of Travis CI. Takeaway: “It’s unfortunate that
          it took me getting to the point where I nearly completely broke before
          I realized how burnt out and unbalanced I actually was. But it’s a
          good reminder to me to pay closer attention to how I’m spending my
          time and how I’m defining myself.”

            Fairly</a
          >
          - by Elad N. Sherf, Ravi S. Gajendran and Vijaya Venkataramani.
          Takeaway: Some managers are “too busy” to be fair. “Over 60 years of
          research finds that fairness is not one simple, singular choice but a
          complex and integrated set of decisions and actions. To be judged as
          fair by employees, bosses have to attend to four aspects of fairness:
          First, they have to ensure distributive fairness by making sure that
          employees are equitably rewarded for their contributions. Second, they
          have to follow transparent and clear procedures in arriving at those
          rewards. These include ensuring decisions are consistently applied
          across people and situations and are based on accurate information,
          suppressing bias in the decision process, and providing opportunities
          for employees to voice concerns. Third, they have to engage in
          informational fairness by explaining the logic behind their decisions
          in a timely manner. Last but not the least, they have to be
          interpersonally fair by treating employees with dignity and respect.”

          - by the John Maxwell Company. Takeaway: If you are feeling crunched
          for time, reevaluate your priorites. The three Ps are <em>P</em>rivate
          Time, <em>P</em>roduction Time, and <em>P</em>eople Time.

            >Thinking Is Work. Give Yourself Time to Do It.</a
          >
          - by Chris Savage. Takeaway: “It is easy to feel guilty if you find
          yourself with the time to think. We have a tech culture that reveres
          the hustle. Crazy work hours and paying your dues are the norm. The
          challenge is that, when scaling, that thinking time becomes even more
          important, and much harder to get.” Delegate to find time to think.

          people busy,” which leads to context-switching and reduces focus. Pull
          systems more naturally create efficient workflows; limit the work in
          progress, to enhance focus.
