            >Chief Technology Officer Job Description: What Does a CTO Do?</a
          >
          - by Roger Jin. Takeaway: how to put the “chief” in CTO. “A great CTO
          should be ready to delegate, while also being comfortable enough to
          work on the frontline, coding alongside their fellow developers.
          Furthermore, they will be required to be even more flexible if they’re
          working in a startup.”

            >The Five Flavors of Being a CTO</a
          >
          - by Koan CEO Matt Tucker. Takeaway: The five types include
          “(External) Evangelist,” a visionary/spokesperson for the technology;
          “(External) Super Sales Engineer,” a charismatic, customer-focused
          spokesperson; “(Internal) Super Engineer,” a coding virtuoso;
          “(Internal) People Leader,” who manages and recruits like a VP
          Engineering (this is antipattern); and “(Internal)
          Innovator/Disruptor,” who’s “next big thing”-oriented.

            >How to Identify and Address CTO Smells: Process</a
          >
          - by Andy Skipper. Takeaway: “Smells” include poor hiring, the
          inability to frame technology challenges against business challenges,
          a lack of succession planning and/or technical vision and/or belief,
          insufficient focus on quality, and an inability to manage upwards or
          sideways.

          - by Matt Aimonetti. Takeaway: Set expectations and put together an
          evaluation framework; and measure and monitory velocity, quality and
          organizational maturity.

          <a href="https://jjude.com/cto-sales/">Mastering Sales as a CTO</a> -
          by Joseph Jude. Takeaway: Most careers turn into sales jobs when you
          get senior enough. For an IT services company, there is none better
          suited to build trust in the minds of prospects than a chief
          technology officer. A CTO can follow a structured approach to handle
          sales calls. The structure could be: Pre-call preparation, on-call
          performance, and retro (post-call and post-closure).
