## Python

- [Robocode](https://github.com/turkishviking/Python-Robocode) - The goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.
- [Robot Rumble](https://robotrumble.org/) - A free and open source AI competition platform. Code an algorithm for a team of robots battling in 1x1 grid-based arenas, and test your skills against others on the site. Robots can move and attack in one of four directions, and the team with more robots after 100 turns wins. Supports Python and Javascript, and comes with a desktop-based command line tool.

## Java

- [Robocode](https://robocode.sourceforge.io) - The goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

## JavaScript

- [Screeps](https://screeps.com) - No point and clicking any longer! You write real JavaScript which controls your units autonomously. Any time, everywhere, even while you are offline.
- [JavaScript Fight Club](https://jsfight.club) - The Red King and the Blue King are at war! Your JavaScript skills are needed to determine the victor: Can you code an effective AI for honor and glory?
- [Elevator Saga](http://play.elevatorsaga.com) - Write JavaScript directly in the browser to program an elevator, such that it reaches its efficiency goals. Start with simple "getting started" scripts, and ramp up to much more complex situations with many floors and multiple elevators.
- [Untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted) - The game presents you with a roguelike-like playing environment and a console window with the JavaScript code generating each level. As loaded, each level is unbeatable, and most of the JavaScript is blocked from editing. The challenge is to open a path to the next level using only the limited tools left open to you.
- [Robot Rumble](https://robotrumble.org/) - A free and open source AI competition platform.
