# State of the OCaml Ecosystem - August 2015

This document aims to be a community-driven review of the current state of the OCaml ecosystem and its suitability for various programming domains and tasks. The idea comes from Gabriel Gonzalez's the post about the [state of the Haskell ecosystem](https://github.com/Gabriel439/post-rfc/blob/master/sotu.md).

The content is grouped in various sections, each one covering a particular topic, inspired by the structure found in [Awesome OCaml](https://github.com/rizo/awesome-ocaml).

The topics are roughly sorted from greatest strengths to greatest weaknesses. Each programming area will also be summarized, compared to other languages, by a single rating of either:

- **Best in class**: the best experience in any language
- **Mature**: suitable for most programmers
- **Immature**: only acceptable for early-adopters
- **Bad**: pretty unusable
