## General

### Integrating with Cassandra

#### Spark

- [Stratio Deep](https://github.com/Stratio/stratio-deep) - Deep is a thin integration layer between Apache Spark and several NoSQL datastores. We actually support Apache Cassandra and MongoDB, but in the near future we will add support for sever other datastores.

## Databases

### Timeseries Databases

#### Custom Time Series

- [Spotify/Heroic](https://github.com/spotify/heroic) - The, now deprecated, Heroic Time Series Database built by Spotify which works on Cassandra and Elasticsearch. The authors mention it will no longer be updated, but should work bug-free.
- [Heroic Documentation](https://spotify.github.io/heroic/docs/overview) - The Heroic Time Series Database documentation.

#### Search / Secondary Indexes

- [Solandra](https://github.com/tjake/Solandra) - Solandra is a real-time distributed search engine built on Apache Solr and Apache Cassandra.

### Libraries

- [Netflix Astyanax](https://github.com/Netflix/astyanax) - This is an old library. Astyanax was a high level Java client for Apache Cassandra, based on Thrift protocol. Not maintained any more.

### Tools

- [trireme](https://github.com/o19s/trireme) - Migration tool providing support for Apache Cassandra, DataStax Enterprise Cassandra, & DataStax Enterprise Solr.

### Open Source applications

- [CMB](https://github.com/Comcast/cmb) - Highly available, horizontally scalable queuing and notification service compatible with AWS SQS and SNS.
