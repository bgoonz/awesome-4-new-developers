      There are a lot of software lists with NLP tools. There are a couple of
      lists with Ruby related projects. There are no lists of only working and
      tested software with documented scope. We’ll try to make one!

      What is awesome? Awesome are documented, maintained and focused tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can something turn not awesome at a point? Yes! Abandoned projects with
      broken dependencies aren’t awesome any more! They leave this list.
