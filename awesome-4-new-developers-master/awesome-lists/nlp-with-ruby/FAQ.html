    <h2 id="what-is-awesome-ruby-nlp-list">What is Awesome Ruby NLP list?</h2>
    <p>
      This list is the <em>first systematic</em> attempt to enlist NLP and CL
      related resources for Ruby. It’s based on other earlier attempts
      e.g. https://github.com/diasks2/ruby-nlp. We strive to provide a list of
      only working high quality libraries. Read
      <a href="motivation.md">why</a> this list is vital for the Ruby community.
    </p>
    <h2 id="why-use-ruby-for-nlp">Why use Ruby for NLP?</h2>
    <p>Everybody uses Python! Nobody hires Ruby developers for NLP tasks.</p>
    <p>
      To avoid a long discussion we can simply postulate: Ruby and Python are
      great programming languages, both very appealing to the community, but
      with different history. Everything written in Ruby could have been written
      in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless we have our personal preferences like dogs over cats, tea
      over coffee etc. That’s why you can choose the language which matches your
      mindset and does not break your mind to get compliant with a programming
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take Ruby if you’re happy with it. Use Python if you like it more. Do
      whatever you want and pay for your decisions!
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you still hesitate look at this great
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D3KfnbTdWw">talk</a> by Jim
      Weirich.

    <h2 id="wait-but-ruby-is-so-slow">Wait … but Ruby is so slow?</h2>
    <p>
      Ruby <strong>IS</strong> comparable in terms of processing speed with
      other high level scripting programming languages like Lua, Perl, Python
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please look at this comparison:

    <h2 id="hm-but-would-i-find-suitable-libraries">
      Hm … but would I find suitable libraries?
    </h2>
    <p>Python has more! Eventually…</p>
    <p>
      Please look at the current
      <a href="https://github.com/arbox/nlp-with-ruby">list</a>, Ruby is
      equipped with all important libraries.
    </p>
    <h2 id="can-i-write-nlp-application-on-the-googles-scale-with-ruby">
      Can I write NLP application on the Google’s scale with Ruby?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The answer is simple and sounds “NO”. Not in pure Ruby. But you can be
      very efficient and use Ruby bindings for Java, C and C++ based libraries.
      And sometimes buying newer hardware can be cheaper than writing everything
      in C++. It’s definitely your choice!
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-do-you-call-list-items">How do you call list items?</h2>
    <p>
      Every library list item has the naming after the Ruby library. The name is
      the exact wording of the <code>gem install lib</code> statement (or
      <code>gem 'lib'</code> in your <code>Gemfile</code>) to facilitate search
      and memoization. That’s why the appropriate item is called
      <code>treat</code> and not <code>Treat</code>.
