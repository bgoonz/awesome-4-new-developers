    <p>
      Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as entity identification,
      entity chunking and entity extraction) is a subtask of information
      extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into
      pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations,
      locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most research on NER systems has been structured as taking an unannotated
      block of text, such as this one:
    </p>
    <p><code>Jim bought 300 shares of Acme Corp. in 2006.</code></p>
    <p>
      And producing an annotated block of text that highlights the names of
      entities:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code
        >[Jim]Person bought 300 shares of [Acme Corp.]Organization in
        [2006]Time.</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, a person name consisting of one token, a two-token
      company name and a temporal expression have been detected and classified.
    </p>

      State-of-the-art NER systems for English produce near-human performance.
      For example, the best system entering MUC-7 scored 93.39% of F-measure
      while human annotators scored 97.60% and 96.95%.[1][2]
