  - PRISMATIC is used as a knowledge resource for QA in Watson
  - PRISMATIC is built using a suite of natural-language processing (NLP) tools that include a dependency parser, a rule-based NER, and a co-reference resolution component. The PRISMATIC creation process consists of three phases.
    1. Corpus processingVDocuments are annotated by a suite of components that perform dependency parsing, co-reference resolution, NER, and relation detection.
    2. Frame extractionVFrames are extracted on the basis of the dependency parses and associated annotations. This phase implements the first stage of our approach.
    3. Frame projectionVFrame projections of interest (e.g., S-V-O projections) are identified over all frames, and frequency information for each projection is tabulated. This phase produces the aggregate statistics from the extracted frames used to infer additional semantics.

  - This paper presents PRISMATIC, a large scale lexicalized relation resource that is automatically created over 30 gb of text.
  - The authors' focus has been on building the infrastructure and gathering the data.

  - The application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to information retrieval promises to generate representational structures that better capture the semantic content of documents.
    In particular, syntactic analysis can highlight the relationships between various terms and phrases in a sentence, which will allow us to distinguish between the example pairs given above and answer queries with higher precision than traditional IR systems.
    However, a syntactically-informed representational structure faces the problem of Hnguistic variations, the phenomenon in which similar semantic content may be expressed in different surface forms.
  - REXTOR(Relations EXtracTOR) provides two separate grammars: one for extracting arbitrary entities from documents, and the other for building relations from the extracted items.

  - Relation and extraction rules
    ```
    Eztraction Rules:
      NounGroup := (PRPZ|DT)? {JJX*} {(NNPX|NNX|NNPS|NNS)+};
      PrepositionalPhrase := IN {NounGroup} ;
      ComplexNounGroup := {NounGroup} {PrepositionalPhrase};
    Relation Rules:
      NounGroup :=> <{0} 'describes' [1]>;
      ComplexNounGroup :=>
        <[0],NounGroup[1]
        ;related-to;
        [1],PrepositionalPhrase[0], NounGroup[1]>;
    ```
    PRPZ: Part-of-speech tag for possessive pronouns <br/>
    DT: " for determiners <br/>
    JJX: " for adjectives <br/>
    JJR: " for comparative adjectives <br/>
    JJS: " for uperlative adjectives <br/>
    NNX: " for singular or mass nouns <br/>
    NNS: " for plural nouns <br/>
    NNPX: " for singular proper nouns <br/>
    NNPS: " for plural proper nouns <br/>
    IN: " for prepositions <br/>
