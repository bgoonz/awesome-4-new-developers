      Edith “Edie” Windsor is best known as a gay rights activist who was the
      lead plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court Case United States v.
      Windsor, which overturned Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
      and led to the legalization of gay marriage. What’s less well known is
      that Windsor was a computer programmer and an engineer, working with the
      UNIVAC at Combustion Engineering, Inc., and later at IBM in the 1950s and
      ’60s, eventually becoming a senior systems engineer.

      Sophie Wilson studied computer science at Cambridge University, and while
      on summer vacation she designed a microcomputer used to control feed for
      cows. In the early days of her career she worked for Acorn Computers,
      where she contributed to the design of the Acorn System 1, an early 8-bit
      computer released in 1979, and later the BBC Micro, which proved hugely
      successful in the UK. Wilson is best known for her development of the
      Acorn RISC Machine (ARM) processor, still used today in 21st century
      smartphones. Wilson is a transgender woman.

      UNIX, which led to the growth of the Usenet in the 1980s. Horton is a
      transgender woman who, in addition to her contributions to technology, has
      also made significant contributions to transgender rights in the
      workplace. In 1997 she asked her then employer Lucent Technologies to
      include the language “gender identity, characteristics, or expression” in
      its Equal Opportunity (EO) nondiscrimination policy, which led to Lucent
      becoming the first company in the United States to add
      transgender-inclusive language to its EO policy.

      Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 –
      27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known
      for her work on Charles Babbage’s proposed mechanical general-purpose
      computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the
      machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and published the first
      algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she
      is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a
      “computing machine” and the first computer programmer.

      Grace Brewster Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist and United
      States Navy rear admiral. One of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark
      I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming who invented one of
      the first compiler related tools. She popularized the idea of
      machine-independent programming languages, which led to the development of
      COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today.

      English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst,
      philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in
      the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation
      of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine,
      which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer. Turing is
      widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
      artificial intelligence. Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts
      and accepted chemical castration treatment as an alternative to prison.
      Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide
      poisoning.

      Christopher S. Strachey was a British computer scientist. He was one of
      the founders of denotational semantics, and a pioneer in programming
      language design. He was a member of the Strachey family, prominent in
      government, arts, administration, and academia.

      Peter John Landin was a British computer scientist. He was one of the
      first to realize that the lambda calculus could be used to model a
      programming language, an insight that is essential to development of both
      functional programming and denotational semantics. Landin, who was
      bisexual, became involved with the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) during the
      early 1970s.

      Roy Clay Sr. is known as the Godfather of Silicon Valley. Mr.Clay was at
      the cutting edge of computing and technology before Microsoft and Apple
      were ever dreamed of. Clay was writing code even before the emergence of
      the civil rights era. In 1963 he was employed by Control Data Corporation
      working on a computer language known as Fortran. For us laymen Fortran is
      a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially
      suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Word of Clay’s
      work got back to David Packard co-founder of Hewlett-Packard and in 1965
      he recruited Clay to set up HP’s computer development business. Packard’s
      idea was to build computers that worked with other HP instrumentation
      products. Clay was vital to this effort because Packard knew almost
      nothing about software.

      During his doctoral fellowship at the University of Michigan in the 1980s,
      Philip Emeagwali researched how to simulate the detection of oil
      reservoirs through the use of computers. Originally from Nigeria, he knew
      more about oil drilling than many of his contemporaries, and he used more
      than 65,000 microprocessors instead of the proposed eight supercomputers,
      breaking computation speed records.
