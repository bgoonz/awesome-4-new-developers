        The Wi-Fi Alliance defines Wi-Fi as any “wireless local area network”
        (WLAN) product based on the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
        Engineers’ (IEEE) 802.11 standards.[1] However, the term “Wi-Fi” is used
        in general English as a synonym for “WLAN” since most modern WLANs are
        based on these standards. “Wi-Fi” is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance.
        The “Wi-Fi Certified” trademark can only be used by Wi-Fi products that
        successfully complete Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certification
        testing.

      6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN">Wikipedia</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that “the Internet Protocol
        could and should be applied even to the smallest devices,”and that
        low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to
        participate in the Internet of Things. The 6LoWPAN group has defined
        encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets
        to be sent and received over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks. IPv4 and IPv6
        are the work horses for data delivery for local-area networks,
        metropolitan area networks, and wide-area networks such as the Internet.
        Likewise, IEEE 802.15.4 devices provide sensing communication-ability in
        the wireless domain. The inherent natures of the two networks though,
        are different.
