    <h1 id="server-badges-and-tags">Server Badges and Tags</h1>
    <p>
      Servers are assigned one or more badges that they conform to. Some badges
      may redirect to external links that the servers own and generally refer
      to, e.g., a homepage or official repository. A badge doesn’t necessarily
      mean that the server is better than the others; it is to represent a
      server’s validity, activity, and wiki. Badges selected for a server
      <strong>doesn’t</strong> relate to
      <a href="https://discordia.me/en/badges">Discord’s own set of badges</a>.

      as an associate community by the subreddit.

      Discord bot source code, and other developments. This clickable badge

    </p>
    <h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>
    <p>
      Some servers contain these tags. Tags are nothing but a reference to
      something generic to save content space.
    </p>
    <h5 id="so-much-more"><code>so much more</code></h5>
    <p>
      A community with a wide range of topics, each of them is equally
      productive in activities. It has so many active channels that it’s
      impossible to squeeze in all of them in <code>Notable channels</code>.
