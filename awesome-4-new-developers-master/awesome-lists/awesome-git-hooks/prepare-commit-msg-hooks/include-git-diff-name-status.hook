# Prepares the commit log message.
# Called by "git commit" with the name of the file that has the
# commit message, followed by the description of the commit
# message's source. The hook's purpose is to edit the commit
# message file.
#
# Includes the output of "git diff --name-status -r"
# into the message, just before the "git status" output. It is
# commented because it doesn't cope with --amend or with squashed
# commits.
#
# Requirements: 
#   * Bash
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "prepare-commit-msg".
