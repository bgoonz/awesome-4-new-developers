      It describes how to set OKRs at company level. First of all, It involves
      taking a hard look at your company, and it involves having a ton of
      difficult conversations about making choices about where the company
      should go
    </p>
    <h1 id="before-the-meeting">Before the meeting</h1>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Few days before the meeting, solicit all the employees to submit the
        Objective they think the company should focus on
      </li>
      <li>Give a very small window to do it: 24 hours should be ok.</li>
      <li>
        Someone should collect and bring forward the best &amp; most popular
        objectives
      </li>
      <li>
        Set aside 4.5 hours: 2 sessions with 30 minute break
        <ul>
          <li>Goal: Cancel the second session. Stay focused</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Each exec should 1 or 2 objective to bring to the meeting</li>
      <li>Have the best employee objectives written down in Post-It notes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1 id="at-the-meeting">At the meeting</h1>
    <p>The meeting must be run with execs</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Keep the meeting small: less than 10 people</li>
      <li>It must include Sr. executive team</li>
      <li>Take away phones and computers</li>
      <li>
        Place the post-its up on the wall.
        <ul>
          <li>Combine duplicates</li>
          <li>
            Look for patterns that suggest people are worried about a particular
            goal.
          </li>
          <li>Combine similar Objectives.<br /></li>
          <li>Stack rank them.</li>
          <li>Finally, narrow them down to three.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Discuss. Debate. Fight. Stack rank. Pick.</li>
      <li>
        All the members of the exec team have to freelist as many metrics as
        they can think of to measure the Objective.
        <ul>
          <li>Freelisting is a Design Thinking technique.</li>
          <li>
            It means to simple write down as many ideas on a topic as you can
          </li>
          <li>One per post-it</li>
          <li>Give the team 10 minutes</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Affinity map of the metrics
        <ul>
          <li>It is a Design Thinking technique</li>
          <li>All it means is you group post-its with like post-its.</li>
          <li>
            e.g If two people both write DAU (Daily Active Users), you can put
            those on top of each other.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Dau, Mau, Wau are all engagement metrics: you can put them next
                to each other.<br />
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            You can pick your three types of metrics.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Write KRs as: “X first”,
                <ul>
                  <li>i.e. “X revenue” or “X acquisitions” or “X DAU” .</li>
                  <li>
                    It’s easier to first discuss <strong>1)</strong>what to
                    measure, <strong>2)</strong>what the value should be and
                    <strong>3)</strong> if it’s really a “shoot for the moon”
                    goal.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Take a <strong>usage metric</strong>,
                <strong>revenue metric</strong>,
                <strong>satisfaction metric</strong>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the values of KRs
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure that they are “shoot for the moon”.</li>
          <li>Confidence level at 50%</li>
          <li>
            Challenge each other:
            <ul>
              <li>Is someone sandbagging?</li>
              <li>Is someone playing safe?</li>
              <li>Is someone foolhardy?</li>
              <li>
                Now, it is time for debate and not halfway through the quarter.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Take 5 minute to discuss the final OKR
        <ul>
          <li>Is it the Objective aspirational and inspirational?</li>
          <li>Do the KRs make sense?</li>
          <li>Are they hard?</li>
          <li>Can you live with this for a full quarter?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
