   - Set the confidence level: a number between 1 (never gonna happen) to 10 (already in the bag).
      - Color them red if below 5
      - Color them green towards 10
2. List last week’s prioritized tasks
   - Write if they have been achieved. If not, explay WHY.
   - Goal: Learn what keeps the organization from accomplishing what it needs to accomplish
3. Next list next week’s priorities
   - Only list three P1’s, and make them meaty accomplishments that encompass multiple steps.
     - e.g. "Finalize spec for project xeno"
   - Add some P2's
   - You want fewer bigger items
4. List any risks or blockers
   - Do not play the BLAME game
   - List anything you know of that could keep your from accomplishing what you set out to do
5. Notes
