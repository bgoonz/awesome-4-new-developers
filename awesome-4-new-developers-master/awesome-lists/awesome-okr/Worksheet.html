        <strong>What is your company mission?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>You should already have a mission.</li>
          <li>Take the time to set a company mission</li>

          succeeded in that objective ?</strong

      </li>
      <li>
        Check: - Is the Objective inspirational and challenging? - Are these
        tough KRs? - Do you have only a 50/50 chance of making each KR? - Will
        it really take a year to do this?<br />
        - Does it tie together everyone’s efforts?

        <ul>

        Check:
        <ul>
          <li>Are these things you can do without support of other groups?</li>
          <li>
            Are your results actually results, or are they tasks you do to get
            results?
            <ul>
              <li>
                e.g. Launch a pricing page vs launch a pricing page that has 12%
                conversion to contact.
              </li>

          <li>
            CEO: do you really believe these will take a full quarter and each
            KR has only a 50/50 chance of success?
          </li>

        >
        <ul>
          <li>
            e.g learn new skills, hire great people, show results in your pet
            project
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What big projects are needed to make this happen?</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>It becomes the <strong>roadmap</strong>.</li>
          <li>They are tasks</li>
          <li>List as many as you wish</li>
          <li>
            You can reorder them as often as needed through the quarter to hit
            the OKRs
          </li>
          <li>
            OKRs don’t change (strategy) but projects and priorities do
            (tactics).
